Given your training on biomedical data, you are an expert on questions related to biology and medicine.You are given the following snippets, from which you must extract the answer to a question. Snippets:The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor suppressors form the TSC1-TSC2 complex, which limits cell growth in response to poor growth conditions. Through its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward Rheb, this complex inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), a key promoter of cell growth.Here, we identify and biochemically characterize TBC1D7 as a stably associated and ubiquitous third core subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. We demonstrate that the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 (TSC-TBC) complex is the functional complex that senses specific cellular growth conditions and possesses Rheb-GAP activity.TBC1D7 knockdown decreases the association of TSC1 and TSC2 leading to decreased Rheb-GAP activity, without effects on the localization of TSC2 to the lysosome.Like the other TSC-TBC components, TBC1D7 knockdown results in increased mTORC1 signaling, delayed induction of autophagy, and enhanced cell growth under poor growth conditions.You must now answer the following biomedical question AS SUCCINCTLY AS YOU CAN.

Snippets:Our results further substantiate that gene scanning of all relevant RET exons is a powerful tool in the management of MEN2 patients,We identified RET mutations in seven of 13 MTCs: five RET-positive cases revealed a mutation in exon 16 (M918T) and two a mutation in exon 10 (C618S and C620S). In four of the RET-positive cases, the mutation was inherited, out of which three were reportedly associated with a multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndrome, i.e. MEN2A (C618S), MEN2A/familial MTC (FMTC) (C620S), and MEN2B (M918T).RET gene mutation carries a risk of MEN2 and MTC in all ethnic groups in South AfricaMutational screening of the RET gene identified a common mutation (C618R) in all 8 (7 FMTC and 1 MEN2A)Gene mutation in the RET-620 position carries significant risk and may be part of a targeted investigation of high-risk areas in HSCRActivating germline RET mutations are presented in patients with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B, whereas inactivating germline mutations in patients with Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). The aim of this study was to evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations of the frequently discussed Tyr791Phe mutation in exon 13 of the RET proto-oncogene. Screening of three groups of patients was performed (276 families with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 122 families with HSCR, and 29 patients with pheochromocytoma). We found this mutation in 3 families with apparently sporadic MTC, 3 families with FMTC/MEN2, 1 patient with pheochromocytoma, and 3 families with HSCR.Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is an inherited, autosomal-dominant disorder caused by deleterious mutations within the RET protooncogene. MEN2 RET mutations are mainly heterozygous, missense sequence changes found in RET exons 10, 11, and 13-16Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs both sporadically and in the context of autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndromes: MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), which are caused by activating germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene.The germline mutation was detected because of the systematic genetic screening of the RET proto-oncogene, which is useful for genetic counseling of potential risk of HSCR and MTC in other family members. This family could be added to the small worldwide cohort of families with MEN2A/FMTC-HSCR.Germline mutations of the ret protooncogene are the underlying cause of the MEN2 syndromes and a proportion of cases of HSCR. In this report, we describe a new kindred in which the MEN2 and HSCR phenotypes are associated with a single C620S point mutation at one of the cysteine codons of the extracellular domain of the ret protooncogene.You must now answer the following biomedical question AS SUCCINCTLY AS YOU CAN.
