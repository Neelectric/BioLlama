Given your training on biomedical data, you are an expert on questions related to biology and medicine.You are given the following snippets, from which you must extract the answer to a question. Snippets:\nantibodies that recognize the Lys-\u025b-Gly-Gly (K-\u025b-GG) remnant produced by trypsin digestion of proteins having ubiquitinated lysine side chains have markedly improved the ability to enrich and detect endogenous ubiquitination sites by mass spectrometry (MS). \nRecent publications have also highlighted the use of peptide-level immunoaffinity enrichment of K-GG modified peptides from whole cell lysates for global characterization of ubiquitination sites. \nIn this work, levels of lysine ubiquitination were quantitated using a structurally homologous label that is chemically similar to the diglycine (GlyGly) tag, which is left at the ubiquitination site upon trypsinolysis\nTandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of immunoprecipitated proteins resulted in the identification of five peptides containing ubiquitin (diglycine) modifications on eIF2B\u03b5\nYou must now answer the following biomedical question AS SUCCINCTLY AS YOU CAN.
