He says that the pain is primarily located in his knees and occurs in sharp bursts that are accompanied by redness and warmth. His past medical history is significant for diabetes though he is not currently taking any medications. He also suffers from occasional diarrhea with fatty stools. Physical exam reveals mild swelling and redness in his knees bilaterally. Furthermore, he is found to be very tan despite the fact that he says he stays out of the sun. He notes that he has always been significantly more tan than anyone else in his family.

He mentions that over the last month he has been having difficulty breathing, especially after climbing stairs. He also says that he has had similar episodes in the past, which were relieved with the use of inhaled bronchodilators, but recently the breathlessness has ceased to respond to them. He also mentions frequent pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. On physical examination, his temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), the pulse is 96/min, the blood pressure is 124/82 mm Hg, and the respirations are 26/min. Auscultation of the chest reveals wheezing bilaterally and a loud pulmonic component of the second heart sound. Two-dimensional echocardiography shows a dilated right ventricle with increased wall thickness. Right heart catheterization is performed, which indicates a pulmonary artery pressure of 30 mm Hg and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 13 mm Hg. There is a significant drop in pulmonary artery pressure after the administration of inhaled nitric oxide. In addition to continued appropriate management of chronic bronchitis, which of the following medications is most likely to improve symptoms in the patient?\n (A) Captopril\n (B) Diltiazem\n (C) Hydralazine\n (D) Isosorbide mononitrate\n (E) Losartan</QUESTION>\n<ANSWER>  (D) Isosorbide mononitrate</ANSWER>\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance!
