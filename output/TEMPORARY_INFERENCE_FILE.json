The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of abciximab in patients with and without high-risk postprocedure features. Protocol-mandated stent implantation was performed in 1586 patients in the Evaluation of Platelet IIb/IIIa Inhibitor for Stenting trial , 783 of whom received abciximab , and was successful in 97 % of the patients. High-risk features were defined as the presence of Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) flow < 3 , presence of thrombus or major dissection , or residual stenosis > 10 %. The primary endpoint was a composite of death , myocardial infarction , and urgent target vessel revascularization at 30 days. High-risk features were present in 21 % of the patients. In patients without high-risk features after stent placement , abciximab reduced the primary endpoint from 9.0 % to 3.9 % ( P < .001 ) compared with 16.2 % to 8.6 % ( P = .046 ) in patients in whom high-risk features were present. There was no statistical evidence of interaction between abciximab treatment and the presence or absence of high-risk features. Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa antagonism with abciximab is equally effective in prevention of a composite of ischemic events in patients with and without high-risk features after stent placement.

Despite clinical evidence for the efficacy of a - noradrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol in the alleviation of anxiety symptoms and the secondary prevention of post traumatic stress disorder , preclinical evidence for a - noradrenergic modulation of BLA activity in humans is missing. Consistent with our a priori hypothesis , propranolol diminished BLA responses to facial expressions , independent of their emotional valence. The absence of activity changes in probabilistically defined visual control regions underscores the specific action of propranolol in the BLA. Our findings provide the missing link between the anxiolytic potential of propranolol and the biological basis of - noradrenergic activation in the human BLA as a key target for the pharmacological inhibition of anxiety neurocircuitry.

There were no differences between the two groups of treatment for time to first drink , length of time before dropout , number of drinking days , and number of heavy drinking days. However , significantly more patients who were treated with amisulpride than those who were treated with placebo were nonabstinent and had relapsed at each visit. Craving for alcohol was significantly higher in the amisulpride than in the placebo group. Transaminases , gamma-glutamyl-transferase , and mean erythrocyte corpuscular volume were regularly higher in the amisulpride group than in the placebo group.

Relapses occurred in 85.7 % ( 12 of 14 ) and 19.4 % ( 4 of 21 ) of treated patients with prevalent precore mutant and prevalent wild-type HBV , respectively ( P = 0.0001 ). High precore mutant HBV levels ( > 20 % of total viremia ) were associated with the lack of permanent response to interferon ( P = 0.01 ). Precore mutant HBV can influence the response to interferon when it reaches significant serum levels ( > 20 % of total viremia ). Therefore , chronic hepatitis B should be treated as early as possible in its natural history before precore mutant HBV is selected as a prevalent virus. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

During a median follow-up period of 37.2 months , venous thromboembolism recurred in 73 of 411 patients assigned to placebo and in 57 of 411 assigned to aspirin ( a rate of 6.5 % per year vs. 4.8 % per year ; hazard ratio with aspirin , 0.74 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.52 to 1.05 ; P = 0.09 ). Aspirin reduced the rate of the two prespecified secondary composite outcomes : the rate of venous thromboembolism , myocardial infarction , stroke , or cardiovascular death was reduced by 34 % ( a rate of 8.0 % per year with placebo vs. 5.2 % per year with aspirin ; hazard ratio with aspirin , 0.66 ; 95 % CI , 0.48 to 0.92 ; P = 0.01 ) , and the rate of venous thromboembolism , myocardial infarction , stroke , major bleeding , or death from any cause was reduced by 33 % ( hazard ratio , 0.67 ; 95 % CI , 0.49 to 0.91 ; P = 0.01 ).

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"The use of pegylated interferon ( PEG-IFN ) plus ribavirin ( RBV ) is currently the recommended treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection. Coinfection with HIV is a negative predictor of response , for reasons not well understood. In an on-treatment analysis , 52.8 % of patients achieved undetectable HCV-RNA ( < 600 IU/ml ) at week 4 , while 63 % and 77.2 % of patients had a decline of at least 2 and 1 log10 , respectively. At week 12 , 73.1 % of patients reached undetectable HCV-RNA , and 83.5 % and 89 % achieved at least a 2 - and 1-log10 drop , respectively. More than 85 % of HCV genotypes 2/3 cleared HCV-RNA at week 4 , a proportion significantly higher when compared with genotypes 1 ( 33.8 % ) and 4 ( 28.6 % ). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified genotype 3 and RBV exposure ( mg/kg of body weight ) as independent predictors of virological response at week 12 of therapy. Early virological response rates to PEG-IFN plus RBV in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients seem to be similar to those reported for HCV-monoinfected subjects. The use of suboptimal doses of RBV in most earlier trials might account for the low response rates seen in coinfected patients. To our knowledge , this is the first report demonstrating that RBV exerts a significant independent effect on early virological response. Therefore , strategies aimed at optimizing doses and adherence to RBV might help to improve responses to HCV therapy in coinfected patients. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"We quantified cardiovascular death and/or left ventricular ( LV ) dilatation in patients from the SAVE trial to determine whether dilatation continued beyond 1 year , whether ACE inhibitor therapy attenuated late LV dilatation , and whether any baseline descriptors predicted late dilatation. Two-dimensional echocardiograms were obtained in 512 patients at 11 + / -3 days and 1 and 2 years postinfarction to assess LV size , percentage of the LV that was akinetic/dyskinetic ( % AD ) , and LV shape index. LV function was assessed by radionuclide ejection fraction. Two hundred sixty-three patients ( 51.4 % ) sustained cardiovascular death and/or LV diastolic dilatation ; 279 ( 54.5 % ) had cardiovascular death and/or systolic dilatation. In 373 patients with serial echocardiograms , LV end-diastolic and end-systolic sizes increased progressively from baseline to 2 years ( both P < .01 ). More patients with LV dilatation had a decrease in ejection fraction : 24.8 % versus 6.8 % ( P < .001 ) ( diastole ) and 25.7 % versus 5.3 % ( P < .001 ) ( systole ). Captopril attenuated diastolic LV dilatation at 2 years ( P = .048 ) , but this effect was carried over from the first year of therapy because changes in LV size with captopril beyond 1 year were similar to those with placebo. Predictors of cardiovascular death and/or dilatation were age ( P = .023 ) , prior infarction ( P < .001 ) , lower ejection fraction ( P < .001 ) , angina ( P = .007 ) , heart failure ( P = .002 ) , LV size ( P < .001 ) , and infarct size ( % AD ) ( P < .001 ). Cardiovascular death and/or LV dilatation occurred in > 50 % of patients by 2 years. LV dilatation is progressive , associated with chamber distortion and deteriorating function that is unaffected by captopril beyond 1 year. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

In the Coumadin Aspirin Reinfarction Study ( CARS ) , we aimed to find out whether a combination of low-dose warfarin and low-dose aspirin would give superior results to standard aspirin monotherapy without excessive bleeding risk. The primary event was first occurrence of reinfarction , non-fatal ischaemic stroke , or cardiovascular death. 1-year life-table estimates for the primary event were 8.6 % ( 95 % CI 7.6-9 .6 ) for 160 mg aspirin , 8.4 % ( 7.4-9 .4 ) for 3 mg warfarin with 80 mg aspirin , and 8.8 % ( 7.6-10 ) for 1 mg warfarin with 80 mg aspirin. Primary comparisons were done with all follow-up data. The relative risk of the primary event for the 160 mg aspirin group compared with the 3 mg warfarin with 80 mg aspirin group was 0.95 ( 0.81-1 .12 , p = 0.57 ). For spontaneous major haemorrhage ( not procedure related ) , 1-year life-table estimates were 0.74 % ( 0.43-1 .1 ) in the 160 mg aspirin group and 1.4 % ( 0.94-1 .8 ) in the 3 mg warfarin with 80 mg aspirin group ( p = 0.014 log rank on follow-up ). For the 3382 patients assigned 3 mg warfarin with 80 mg aspirin , the INR results were : at week 1 ( n = 2985 ) median 1.51 ( IQR 1.23-2 .13 ) ; at week 4 ( n = 2701 ) 1.27 ( 1.13-1 .64 ) ; at month 6 ( n = 2145 ) 1.19 ( 1.08-1 .44 ). Low , fixed-dose warfarin ( 1 mg or 3 mg ) combined with low-dose aspirin ( 80 mg ) in patients who have had myocardial infarction does not provide clinical benefit beyond that achievable with 160 mg aspirin monotherapy. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Adenocarcinoma ( 53.9 % ) was the predominant histologic type ; 92 % of patients were in stage IV. The two groups were balanced for prognostic factors ; however , group A had fewer patients with significant weight loss and no patient with lung cancer as a second malignancy or after radiotherapy for brain metastases. Grade 3 or greater toxicity was rare : anemia in 0.8 and 3.2 % , neutropenia in 21.6 and 22.6 % , thrombocytopenia in 0 and 1.6 % , and nausea/vomiting in 4 and 8.1 % for arms A and B , respectively. Alopecia was seen in 54.5 % of patients in arm B , as compared with 9.7 % in arm A. No patient died of treatment-related toxicity. During cycle 5 , 47.7 % of patients in arm A and 60.7 % in arm B reported improved well-being , as compared with the status before chemotherapy. Patients in arm A had no complete remission , 32.8 % partial responses , 48 % minimal responses or stable disease , 13.6 % progressions , and 5.6 % were not evaluable. For arm B , the corresponding figures are as follows : complete remission 0.8 % , partial responses 46 % ( for overall response rate of 46.8 % ) , minimal responses or stable disease 36.3 % , progression 12.1 % , and not evaluable 4.8 %. Median progression-free survival was 5.5 and 6.0 months , median overall survival was 10.1 and 10.0 months , and 1-year survival was 46.6 and 41.1 % for arms A and B , respectively. For the 71 patients with squamous carcinoma , arm B seems superior to arm A , as seen by the higher overall response rate ( 51.3 versus 35.5 % ) , longer median progression-free survival ( 6.2 versus 4.9 months ) , and longer median survival ( 11.3 versus 8.5 months ). However , because of the small number of patients , these differences did not reach the level of statistical significance.

The area under the curve was linearly proportional to the dose from 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg. Baseline average plasma Gb3 was 9.12 + / - 2.61 nmol/mL and after 10 weeks of treatment was significantly reduced by about 50 % in each group with no statistically significant differences between groups. Reduction of plasma Gb3 levels was independent of dose or dose frequency in the range tested. These observations , coupled with the clinical trial experience of both agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta , indicate that the standard dose of agalsidase alfa is sufficient to maximally reduce plasma Gb3. However , because plasma Gb3 is not a validated surrogate of disease severity in Fabry disease , further clinical study will be required to determine the optimal dosing regimen for providing maximal clinical benefit. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

During morning rounds, she reports a \u201cpus-like\u201d discharge and shaking chills overnight. She also endorses increased uterine cramping compared to the day before, but her postpartum course has otherwise been uneventful with a well-healing incision and normal vaginal bleeding. The patient\u2019s prenatal care was complicated by HIV with a recent viral load of 400 copies/mL, type I diabetes well controlled on insulin, and a history of herpes simplex virus encephalitis in her first child. She did not have any genital lesions during the most recent pregnancy. Four days ago, she presented to the obstetric triage unit after spontaneous rupture of membranes and onset of labor. She made slow cervical change and reached full dilation after 16 hours, but there was limited fetal descent. Cephalopelvic disproportion was felt to be the reason for arrest of descent, so prophylactic ampillicin was administered and C-section was performed. A vaginal hand was required to dislodge the fetus\u2019s head from the pelvis, and a healthy baby boy was delivered. On postpartum day 3, her temperature is 101.5\u00b0F (38.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 119/82 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 14/min. Her incision looks clean and dry, there is mild suprapubic tenderness, and a foul yellow discharge tinged with blood is seen on her pad. Which of the following is the most significant risk factor for this patient\u2019s presentation?\n (A) HIV positive status\n (B) Prolonged rupture of membranes\n (C) C-section after onset of labor\n (D) History of herpes simplex virus in previous pregnancy\n (E) Maternal diabetes</QUESTION>\n<ANSWER> \nPlease select one letter.\n</ANSWER>.

Early and late recovery variables were similar in the two treatment groups ; however , 65 % N2O produced a 19 % decrease in the propofol maintenance dosage requirement. One patient ( 3 % ) experienced nausea prior to discharge in the propofol-N2O group , and two patients ( 6 % ) experienced nausea at home in the propofol alone group. None of the patients vomited or received antiemetic medication during the 24 hours postdischarge period. Ninety-seven percent of patients receiving propofol alone and all of the patients in the propofol-N2O group were `` very satisfied '' with their anesthetic experience. In outpatients undergoing office-based surgical procedures with propofol anesthesia , administration of 65 % N2O decreased the anesthetic requirement without increasing PONV. Therefore , use of a propofol-N2O combination may be a cost-effective alternative to propofol alone for office-based anesthesia. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Current dietary recommendations for patients with heart failure ( HF ) are largely based on data from non-HF populations ; evidence on associations of dietary patterns with outcomes in HF is limited. We therefore evaluated associations of Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) diet scores with mortality among postmenopausal women with HF. URL : http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier : NCT00000611. Women 's Health Initiative participants were followed up from the date of HF hospitalization through the date of death or last participant contact before August 2009. Mediterranean and DASH diet scores were calculated from food-frequency questionnaires. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for demographics , health behaviors , and health status were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ). For a median of 4.6 years of follow-up , 1385 of 3215 ( 43.1 % ) participants who experienced a HF hospitalization died. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were 1 ( reference ) , 1.05 ( 95 % CI , 0.89-1 .24 ) , 0.97 ( 95 % CI , 0.81-1 .17 ) , and 0.85 ( 95 % CI , 0.70-1 .02 ) across quartiles of the Mediterranean diet score ( P trend = 0.08 ) and 1 ( reference ) , 1.04 ( 95 % CI , 0.89-1 .21 ) , 0.83 ( 95 % CI , 0.70-0 .98 ) , and 0.84 ( 95 % CI , 0.70-1 .00 ) across quartiles of the DASH diet score ( P trend = 0.01 ). Diet score components , vegetables , nuts , and whole grain intake , were inversely associated with mortality. Higher DASH diet scores were associated with modestly lower mortality in women with HF , and there was a nonsignificant trend toward an inverse association with Mediterranean diet scores. These data provide support for the concept that dietary recommendations developed for other cardiovascular conditions or general populations may also be appropriate in patients with HF. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

In addition , the ratio of gastric mucosal perfusion ( local oxygen delivery ) to systemic oxygen delivery was increased after norepinephrine plus dobutamine as compared with norepinephrine alone and epinephrine ( p < .05 ). Although values of intramucosal pH and gastroarterial PCO2 tended to be higher with norepinephrine plus dobutamine compared with those obtained with norepinephrine and epinephrine , differences were not statistically significant. For the same mean arterial pressure in patients with septic shock , our study showed that administration of epinephrine increased gastric mucosal perfusion more than norepinephrine administration alone.

The database from the Spinal Cord Injury Locomotor Trial ( SCILT ) , which tested 2 interventions for mobility upon admission for initial rehabilitation of an incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , was used to compare the walking speed employed for each test. The mean speed for the 15.2-m walk did not differ from that used for the 6-minute walk at 3 and 6 months but was significantly faster at 12 months. Differences became apparent at each assessment in patients in the highest quartiles ( > 1.0 m/s ) for the 15.2-m walk. Their speed was from 14 % to 24 % higher than the speed used for the 6-minute walk. The speed of the 15.2-m walk as a measure of walking ability compared to the distance walked in 6 minutes may not represent separable domains of mobility. Differences were apparent only in the most highly functional patients , who could ambulate in the community.

Prednisolone pretreatment resulted in an increase in the proportion of mutant in patients with initially low percentages ( < or = 25 % ) of mutant.

Consistent with our a priori hypothesis , propranolol diminished BLA responses to facial expressions , independent of their emotional valence. The absence of activity changes in probabilistically defined visual control regions underscores the specific action of propranolol in the BLA. Our findings provide the missing link between the anxiolytic potential of propranolol and the biological basis of - noradrenergic activation in the human BLA as a key target for the pharmacological inhibition of anxiety neurocircuitry.

Low-dose intradermal ( i.d. ) inoculations and supplementary intramuscular ( i.m. ) injections have been reported to improve the response rate in previous non-responder chronic uraemic patients , but no cost-effectiveness evaluations have been made about this issue. One month after completion of re-vaccination protocol , seroconversion rates ( 100 % vs 48 % , P = 0.008 ) and proportion of patients who elicited protective anti-HBs titres ( 96 % vs 40 % , P = 0.0001 ) were significantly higher in i.d. compared to i.m. patients. The levels of anti-HBs expressed as geometric mean titres and 95 % confidence intervals ( GMT ( 95 % CI ) ) , were significantly increased in i.d. than in i.m. groups , 100 ( 44-187 ) vs 26 ( 14-52 ) mUI/ml ( P = 0.018 ). At month 12 , the seroconversion rates were 57 vs 14 % in i.d. and i.m. groups respectively ( P = 0.158 ) ; the seroprotection rate was higher in i.d. individuals in comparison with i.m. patients , 50 vs 0 % , P = 0.072. At month 20 , the seroconversion rates were 54 and 0 % among i.d. and i.m. patients respectively ( P = 0.055 ) ; the seroprotection rate was higher in i.d. than in i.m. group ( 30 vs 0 % , P = 0.2 ). At month 20 , the median anti-HBs titres in i.d. patients were 21 mUI/ml , and GMT ( 95 % CI ) were 20.9 ( 2-54 ) mUI/ml. No important general or local side-effects were observed. The cost of our schedule was $ 92 US whereas the costs of other re-vaccination protocols ranged between 138 and $ 807 US. Our results show that the unresponsiveness to recombinant yeast-derived vaccine may be mostly reversed by repeated low-dose i.d. injections of the same agent. In spite of an equal amount of HBsAg received , i.d. hepatitis B re-vaccination shows higher immunogenicity compared to i.m. administration over a 20-month observation period. Cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated that the intradermal administration of HB vaccine is the most clinically effective re-vaccination strategy ; it is also the most unexpensive one. We strongly recommend low-dose intradermal inoculations in order to re-vaccinate chronic dialysis patients who fail to respond to hepatitis B vaccination. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

SIMV rate was reduced during SIMV + PS from 21.4 + / - 6.6 to 11.4 + / - 6.6 b/minute. Arterial oxygen saturation , transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension and FiO ( 2 ) remained unchanged. Minute ventilation , total respiratory rate and mean airway pressure were higher during SIMV + PS. Per-breath inspiratory effort was lower during SIMV + PS and this was more striking during SIMV + PS6. Spontaneous inspiratory effort per minute increased during SIMV + PS3 , but this increase was averted during SIMV + PS6.

We report on the first controlled study comparing acute and continuous clinical outcomes in RC and non-RC manic patients treated with olanzapine. RC ( N = 90 , 35 % ) versus non-RC subjects ( N = 164 , 65 % ) were younger at intake ( p = .02 ) , less often psychotic ( p < .0001 ) , and more likely to have familial bipolar disorder ( p < .0001 ) , abused substances ( p = .01 ) , more previous hospitalizations ( p = .004 ) , and many more illness episodes ( p < .001 ). In initial blinded trial outcomes , relative responses ( > or = 50 % improvement of mania ) to olanzapine/placebo were similar in RC and non-RC subjects , though early responses to olanzapine favored RC over non-RC subjects ( p = .003 ) , and long-term outcomes favored non-RC subjects ( p = .05 ). Fewer RC subjects achieved strictly defined initial symptomatic remission ( p = .014 ) within a year ; RC subjects were more likely to experience recurrences ( p = .002 ) , especially of depressive illness ( < .001 ) , and had more rehospitalizations ( p = .01 ) and suicide attempts ( p = .03 ). RC bipolar I patients showed major initial differences and more rapid initial clinical changes , especially toward depression , with less favorable long-term outcomes than non-RC cases during treatment with olanzapine.

In this updated analysis of the entire patient cohort , we provide additional support for these findings and demonstrate that patients in the ICRF-187 group received more cycles ( median , 11 ) and higher cumulative doses ( median , 500 mg/m2 ) of doxorubicin than patients in the control group ( median , nine cycles , P less than .01 ; and 441 mg/m2 , P less than .05 ). Twenty-six patients in the ICRF-187 group received doxorubicin doses of at least 700 mg/m2 , and among them , 11 patients received 1,000 mg/m2 or more. Only three patients in the control group received doxorubicin doses of 700 mg/m2 ; the maximum dose administered to one patient in this group was 950 mg/m2. ICRF-187 cardiac protection was demonstrated by difference in incidence of clinical congestive heart failure ( CHF ; two patients in the ICRF-187 group v 20 in the control group ; P less than .0001 ) and by differences in resting left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) determined by multigated radionuclide ( MUGA ) scan from baselines and that required patient removal from study ( five patients in the ICRF-187 group had a decrease in LVEF to less than 0.45 or a decrease from the baseline LVEF of 0.20 or more v 32 in the control group ; P less than .000001 ).

This had declined to 28 ( 18 % ) by the end of the 6-month follow-up period , during which support for the intervention had been removed and those wishing to continue exercise had to pay their own costs for maintaining their exercise treatment. High levels of co-morbidity were recorded in both groups. Nearly two thirds of all patients had a significant other illness in addition to their OA. Fifty-four control and 53 exercise patients had hospital inpatient episodes during the study period. Water exercise remained effective in the main study but overall effect size was small , on WOMAC pain at 1 year , a reduction of about 10 % in group mean pain score. This had declined , and was non-significant , at 18 months. Mean cost difference estimates showed a saving in the water exercise group of pound123 -- 175 per patient per annum and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from pound3838 to pound5951 per quality-adjusted life-year ( QALY ). Net reduction in pain was achieved at a net saving of pound135 -- 175 per patient per annum and the ceiling valuation of pound580 -- 740 per unit of WOMAC pain reduction was favourably low. Group-based exercise in water over 1 year can produce significant reduction in pain and improvement in physical function in older adults with lower limb OA , and may be a useful adjunct in the management of hip and/or knee OA. The water-exercise programme produced a favourable cost -- benefit outcome , using reduction in WOMAC pain as the measure of benefit. Further research is suggested into other similar public health interventions. Investigation is also needed into how general practice can best be supported to facilitate access to participants for research trials in healthcare , as well as an examination of the infrastructure and workforce capacities for physical activity delivery and the potential extent to which healthcare may be supported in this way. More detailed research is required to develop a better understanding of the types of exercise that will work for the different biomechanical subtypes of knee and hip OA and investigation is needed on access and environmental issues for physical activity programmes for older people , from both a provider and a participant perspective , the societal costs of the different approaches to the management of OA and longer term trends in outcome measures ( costs and effects ). \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Four of the 24 implants were unavailable for analysis. One implant was mobile at abutment connection and another implant was mobile 2 weeks after abutment connection ; both implants had to be removed. The bone around two implants was destroyed during the removal with the trephine bur ; therefore , these two implants could not be evaluated histologically either. No differences in the histologic appearance of the peri-implant bone between the different groups could be observed. Histomorphometrically , the implant surface in contact with mineralized bone as a fraction of the implant surface ( measured from the buccal to the lingual implant shoulder ) varied between 59 % and 73 %. The implant surface in contact with mineralized bone from the first bone-to-implant contact buccally to the first bone-to-implant contact lingually varied between 80.6 % and 91.5 %. The values for the distance from the implant shoulder to the first bone-to-implant contact , i.e. peri-implant bone loss , varied from 1.1 to 2.2 mm. No statistically significant differences could be found between any of the evaluated variables. This clinical investigation is the first to evaluate the hard tissue reactions to different plaque accumulation periods. Within the limits of this experiment , it can be concluded that the bone reaction toward the different plaque accumulation periods and in the different plaque control/accumulation groups were similar.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Smoking is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Because previous studies have shown that smoking affects vasomotor response , we hypothesized that smoking may also acutely alter aortic elastic properties. We studied 40 male current and long-term smokers who underwent diagnostic cardiac catheterization for chest-pain evaluation. Twenty subjects ( age , 48 + / - 2 years , mean + / - SEM ) were randomly assigned to smoking and 20 ( age , 47 + / - 2 years ) to sham smoking studies. Aortic elastic properties were studied with the determination of the aortic pressure-diameter relation before smoking , every minute for the first 5 minutes after the initiation of smoking or sham smoking , and every 5 minutes for the following 15 minutes. Instantaneous diameter of the thoracic aorta was measured with a special ultrasonic dimension catheter developed in our laboratory and previously validated. Instantaneous aortic pressure was measured at the same site as was diameter with a Millar micromanometer. Smoking was associated with significant changes in the aortic pressure-diameter relation that denote deterioration of the elastic properties and were maintained during the whole study period : the slope of the pressure-diameter loop became steeper ( baseline , 35.43 + / - 1.38 ; minute 1 , 45.26 + / - 1.65 ; peak at minute 10 , 46.36 + / - 1.69 mm Hg/mm ; P < .001 ) and aortic distensibility decreased ( baseline , 2.08 + / - 0.12 ; minute 1 , 1.60 + / - 0.08 ; nadir at minute 5 , 1.54 + / - 0.07 x 10 ( -6 ) cm2.dyne-1 ; P < .001 ). In contrast , no changes in aortic elasticity indexes were observed with sham smoking. Smoking is associated with an acute deterioration of aortic elastic properties.

This result was attributed to the use of an older excimer laser PRK algorithm that was used at the initiation of the study. No eye that had PRK was overcorrected by 0.50 D or more at 1 year postoperatively , while seven eyes that had RK were overcorrected by at least 0.50 D and six were overcorrected by 1.00 D. Eyes that had PRK had a statistically significant mean shift in the myopic direction between 6 and 12 months postoperatively ; two RK eyes had hyperopic shifts of 1.00 D. Three RK eyes and two PRK eyes failed to achieve an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better by 12 months postoperatively. No eye lost any best corrected visual acuity. The two procedures were comparably safe and effective in treating mild to moderate myopia under this protocol. Eyes that had PRK were somewhat more myopic at 1 year after surgery , attributable to the older PRK ablation algorithm. Adoption of newer ( current ) laser algorithms has improved the predictability of PRK. There was also evidence of reduced variability of outcome in the PRK group.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of consuming two daily HGI or LGI meals for five consecutive days on substrate oxidation before the exercise and in the concentrations of glucose , insulin and free fatty acids before and during a high intensity exercise. The consumption of HGI meals resulted in higher areas under the glycemic and insulinemic curves in the postprandial period. However , glycemia did not differ by study treatment during exercise. There were no differences in free fatty acids in the postprandial period or in lactate levels during exercise. LGI meals resulted in lower fat oxidation and higher carbohydrate oxidation than the HGI meal in the postprandial period.

Only three patients in the control group received doxorubicin doses of 700 mg/m2 ; the maximum dose administered to one patient in this group was 950 mg/m2. ICRF-187 cardiac protection was demonstrated by difference in incidence of clinical congestive heart failure ( CHF ; two patients in the ICRF-187 group v 20 in the control group ; P less than .0001 ) and by differences in resting left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) determined by multigated radionuclide ( MUGA ) scan from baselines and that required patient removal from study ( five patients in the ICRF-187 group had a decrease in LVEF to less than 0.45 or a decrease from the baseline LVEF of 0.20 or more v 32 in the control group ; P less than .000001 ).

Eyes that had PRK had a statistically significant mean shift in the myopic direction between 6 and 12 months postoperatively ; two RK eyes had hyperopic shifts of 1.00 D. Three RK eyes and two PRK eyes failed to achieve an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better by 12 months postoperatively. No eye lost any best corrected visual acuity. The two procedures were comparably safe and effective in treating mild to moderate myopia under this protocol. Eyes that had PRK were somewhat more myopic at 1 year after surgery , attributable to the older PRK ablation algorithm. Adoption of newer ( current ) laser algorithms has improved the predictability of PRK. There was also evidence of reduced variability of outcome in the PRK group. The PRK eyes did not exhibit hyperopic shifts during the 1 year follow-up. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

However , little is known about the effect of obesity on treatment efficacy. We evaluated the association of obesity with outcomes and with tamoxifen efficacy in women with early-stage , hormone-responsive breast cancer participating in a multicenter cancer cooperative group clinical trial. The hazard of breast cancer recurrence was the same among obese ( BMI > or = 30.0 kg/m2 ) women as compared with underweight and normal-weight women ( BMI < 25.0 ; hazard ratio [ HR ] = 0.98 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 0.80 to 1.18 ). Contralateral breast cancer hazard was higher in obese women than in underweight/normal-weight women ( HR = 1.58 , 95 % CI = 1.10 to 2.25 ) , as was the risk of other primary cancers ( HR = 1.62 , 95 % CI = 1.16 to 2.24 ). Compared with normal-weight women , obese women had greater all-cause mortality ( HR = 1.31 , 95 % CI = 1.12 to 1.54 ) and greater risk of deaths due to causes unrelated to breast cancer ( HR = 1.49 , 95 % CI = 1.15 to 1.92 ). Breast cancer mortality was not statistically significantly increased for obese women ( HR = 1.20 , 95 % CI = 0.97 to 1.49 ). Tamoxifen reduced breast cancer recurrence and mortality , regardless of BMI. For women with lymph node-negative , ER-positive breast cancer , obesity was not associated with a material increase in recurrence risk or a change in tamoxifen efficacy. However , because obesity was associated with increased risks of contralateral breast cancer , of other primary cancers , and of overall mortality , it may influence long-term outcomes for breast cancer survivors. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Excessive early migration of femoral stems following total hip arthroplasty and tibial components following total knee arthroplasty is associated with their long-term survival and allows reliable early evaluation of implant performance. However , a similar relationship involving acetabular components following hip arthroplasty has not been evaluated. This prospective , long-term study with clinical and Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis ( RSA ) follow-up establishes the existence of this relationship and its associated diagnostic performance. Eleven acetabular components were observed to be loose on conventional radiographs after a mean of seventy-six months ( range , twelve to 140 months ). During the first two postoperative years , the failed acetabular components showed markedly greater and more rapid cranial translation and sagittal rotation. Both cranial translation ( hazard ratio = 19.9 [ 95 % confidence interval , 4.94 to 80.0 ] , p < 0.001 ) and sagittal rotation ( hazard ratio = 11.1 [ 95 % confidence interval , 2.83 to 43.9 ] , p = 0.001 ) were strong risk factors for late aseptic loosening. Eight of the eleven failed components showed a distinctive pattern of excessive cranial translation combined with excessive sagittal rotation. The associated diagnostic performance of two-year cranial translation and/or sagittal rotation for predicting late aseptic loosening of the acetabular component was good ( area under the receiver operating characteristic curve , 0.88 [ 95 % confidence interval , 0.74 to 1.00 ; p < 0.001 ] and 0.84 [ 95 % confidence interval , 0.68 to 1.00 ; p = 0.001 ] , respectively ). Early migration , as measured by RSA at two years postoperatively , has good diagnostic capabilities for the detection of acetabular components at risk for future aseptic loosening , and this method appears to be an appropriate means of assessing the performance of new implants or implant-related changes. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

The database from the Spinal Cord Injury Locomotor Trial ( SCILT ) , which tested 2 interventions for mobility upon admission for initial rehabilitation of an incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , was used to compare the walking speed employed for each test. The mean speed for the 15.2-m walk did not differ from that used for the 6-minute walk at 3 and 6 months but was significantly faster at 12 months. Differences became apparent at each assessment in patients in the highest quartiles ( > 1.0 m/s ) for the 15.2-m walk. Their speed was from 14 % to 24 % higher than the speed used for the 6-minute walk. The speed of the 15.2-m walk as a measure of walking ability compared to the distance walked in 6 minutes may not represent separable domains of mobility. Differences were apparent only in the most highly functional patients , who could ambulate in the community.

False-positive and true-positive patients did not differ in symptom profile or in physiological variables. During ambulatory monitoring ( 15 true-positive , 15 false-positive ) 22 attacks were registered. Transcutaneous end-tidal , pCO2 decreased during only seven. The decreases were slight and apparently followed the onset of the attack , which suggests that hyperventilation is a consequence rather than a cause of the attack.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Advances in the treatment of cardiovascular disease have increased costs ; annual cardiovascular healthcare expenditure in the United States currently exceeds $ 100 billion. Physicians and third-party payers need to assess the economic impact of treatments that reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in which simvastatin reduced the risk of death by 30 % ( P = .0003 ) over the median follow-up period of 5.4 years in patients with previous myocardial infarction or stable angina pectoris as a result of a 42 % reduction in the risk of coronary deaths ( P = .00001 ). In the present report , data prospectively collected from hospital admissions were analyzed to evaluate the impact of simvastatin on healthcare resource use and perform a cost-minimization analysis. In the placebo group ( n = 2223 ) , there were 1905 hospitalizations ( average duration , 7.9 days ) for acute cardiovascular events or coronary revascularization procedures among 937 patients , whereas in the simvastatin group ( n = 2221 ) , there were 1403 such hospitalizations ( average duration , 7.1 days ) among 720 patients ( all differences , P < .0001 ). The corresponding number of hospital days was 15089 and 9951 in the two groups , respectively ( 34 % reduction , P < .0001 ). In the United States , the resulting reduction in hospitalization costs over the 5.4 years of the trial would be $ 3872 per patient , reducing the effective cost of simvastatin by 88 % to $ 0.28 per day. In addition to reducing mortality and morbidity in coronary heart disease patients , simvastatin markedly reduces use of hospital services , thus offsetting most of its cost. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Protocol-mandated stent implantation was performed in 1586 patients in the Evaluation of Platelet IIb/IIIa Inhibitor for Stenting trial , 783 of whom received abciximab , and was successful in 97 % of the patients. High-risk features were defined as the presence of Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) flow < 3 , presence of thrombus or major dissection , or residual stenosis > 10 %. The primary endpoint was a composite of death , myocardial infarction , and urgent target vessel revascularization at 30 days. High-risk features were present in 21 % of the patients.

There was no statistical evidence of interaction between abciximab treatment and the presence or absence of high-risk features.

This result was attributed to the use of an older excimer laser PRK algorithm that was used at the initiation of the study. No eye that had PRK was overcorrected by 0.50 D or more at 1 year postoperatively , while seven eyes that had RK were overcorrected by at least 0.50 D and six were overcorrected by 1.00 D. Eyes that had PRK had a statistically significant mean shift in the myopic direction between 6 and 12 months postoperatively ; two RK eyes had hyperopic shifts of 1.00 D. Three RK eyes and two PRK eyes failed to achieve an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better by 12 months postoperatively. No eye lost any best corrected visual acuity. The two procedures were comparably safe and effective in treating mild to moderate myopia under this protocol. Eyes that had PRK were somewhat more myopic at 1 year after surgery , attributable to the older PRK ablation algorithm.

Despite clinical evidence for the efficacy of a - noradrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol in the alleviation of anxiety symptoms and the secondary prevention of post traumatic stress disorder , preclinical evidence for a - noradrenergic modulation of BLA activity in humans is missing. Consistent with our a priori hypothesis , propranolol diminished BLA responses to facial expressions , independent of their emotional valence. The absence of activity changes in probabilistically defined visual control regions underscores the specific action of propranolol in the BLA. Our findings provide the missing link between the anxiolytic potential of propranolol and the biological basis of - noradrenergic activation in the human BLA as a key target for the pharmacological inhibition of anxiety neurocircuitry.

Longer length of operation time , shorter length of catheterization and hospital stay were experienced by patients who underwent PVP. Although patients who underwent OP showed a higher transfusion rate , adverse events in general were minor and of similar profile in both groups. All functional parameters improved significantly compared to baseline values in both groups. There was no difference in IPSS between the two groups at 3 , 6 , 12 , and 18 months postoperatively. Patients who underwent OP scored better in the IPSS-Quality of life score at 18 months postoperatively. At 18 months there were no significant differences between the two groups in the Qmax , post void residual urine volume and in the International Index for Erectile function-5 questionnaire. At three months prostate volume was significantly lower in the OP group and remained as such throughout follow-up.

In this updated analysis of the entire patient cohort , we provide additional support for these findings and demonstrate that patients in the ICRF-187 group received more cycles ( median , 11 ) and higher cumulative doses ( median , 500 mg/m2 ) of doxorubicin than patients in the control group ( median , nine cycles , P less than .01 ; and 441 mg/m2 , P less than .05 ). Twenty-six patients in the ICRF-187 group received doxorubicin doses of at least 700 mg/m2 , and among them , 11 patients received 1,000 mg/m2 or more. Only three patients in the control group received doxorubicin doses of 700 mg/m2 ; the maximum dose administered to one patient in this group was 950 mg/m2. ICRF-187 cardiac protection was demonstrated by difference in incidence of clinical congestive heart failure ( CHF ; two patients in the ICRF-187 group v 20 in the control group ; P less than .0001 ) and by differences in resting left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) determined by multigated radionuclide ( MUGA ) scan from baselines and that required patient removal from study ( five patients in the ICRF-187 group had a decrease in LVEF to less than 0.45 or a decrease from the baseline LVEF of 0.20 or more v 32 in the control group ; P less than .000001 ).

ICRF-187 cardiac protection was observed in patients with and without prior chest-wall radiation or other risk factors for developing doxorubicin cardiac toxicity.

Clinical outcomes examined were the dose effects of inhaled NO on mortality , the number of days alive and off mechanical ventilation , and the number of days alive after meeting oxygenation criteria for extubation. A total of 177 patients were enrolled over a 14-month period. An acute response to treatment gas , defined as a PaO2 increase > or = 20 % , was seen in 60 % of the patients receiving inhaled NO with no significant differences between dose groups. Twenty-four percent of placebo patients also had an acute response to treatment gas during the first 4 hrs. The initial increase in oxygenation translated into a reduction in the FIO2 over the first day and in the intensity of mechanical ventilation over the first 4 days of treatment , as measured by the oxygenation index. There were no differences among the pooled inhaled NO groups and placebo with respect to mortality rate , the number of days alive and off mechanical ventilation , or the number of days alive after meeting oxygenation criteria for extubation. However , patients receiving 5 ppm inhaled NO showed an improvement in these parameters. In this dose group , the percentage of patients alive and off mechanical ventilation at day 28 ( a post hoc analysis ) was higher ( 62 % vs. 44 % ) than the placebo group. There was no apparent difference in the number or type of adverse events reported among those patients receiving inhaled NO compared with placebo. Four patients had methemoglobin concentrations > 5 %. The mean inspired nitrogen dioxide concentration in inhaled NO patients was 1.5 ppm.

Results replicate and expand upon previous studies examining the association between drinking goal and treatment outcome.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Eyes that had PRK had statistically significantly more residual myopia than RK-treated eyes at 3 , 6 , and 12 months postoperatively. This result was attributed to the use of an older excimer laser PRK algorithm that was used at the initiation of the study. No eye that had PRK was overcorrected by 0.50 D or more at 1 year postoperatively , while seven eyes that had RK were overcorrected by at least 0.50 D and six were overcorrected by 1.00 D. Eyes that had PRK had a statistically significant mean shift in the myopic direction between 6 and 12 months postoperatively ; two RK eyes had hyperopic shifts of 1.00 D. Three RK eyes and two PRK eyes failed to achieve an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better by 12 months postoperatively. No eye lost any best corrected visual acuity. The two procedures were comparably safe and effective in treating mild to moderate myopia under this protocol. Eyes that had PRK were somewhat more myopic at 1 year after surgery , attributable to the older PRK ablation algorithm. Adoption of newer ( current ) laser algorithms has improved the predictability of PRK. There was also evidence of reduced variability of outcome in the PRK group.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Characterization of the variations in the metabolomic profiles of elderly people is a necessary step to understand changes associated with aging. This study assessed whether diets with different fat quality and supplementation with coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ ) affect the metabolomic profile in urine analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy from elderly people. Multivariate analysis showed differences between diets when comparing Med + CoQ diet and saturated fat diet , with greater hippurate urine levels after Med + CoQ diet and higher phenylacetylglycine levels after saturated fat diet in women. Following consumption of Med + CoQ , hippurate excretion was positively correlated with CoQ and - carotene plasma levels and inversely related to Nrf2 , thioredoxin , superoxide dismutase 1 , and gp91 ( phox ) subunit of NADPH oxidase gene expression. After saturated fat diet consumption , phenylacetylglycine excretion was inversely related to CoQ plasma level and positively correlated with isoprostanes urinary level. The association between hippurate excretion and antioxidant biomarkers along with the relationship between phenylacetylglycine excretion and oxidant biomarkers suggests that the long-term consumption of a Med + CoQ diet could be beneficial for healthy aging and a promising challenge in the prevention of processes related to chronic oxidative stress , such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Physicians and third-party payers need to assess the economic impact of treatments that reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in which simvastatin reduced the risk of death by 30 % ( P = .0003 ) over the median follow-up period of 5.4 years in patients with previous myocardial infarction or stable angina pectoris as a result of a 42 % reduction in the risk of coronary deaths ( P = .00001 ). In the present report , data prospectively collected from hospital admissions were analyzed to evaluate the impact of simvastatin on healthcare resource use and perform a cost-minimization analysis. In the placebo group ( n = 2223 ) , there were 1905 hospitalizations ( average duration , 7.9 days ) for acute cardiovascular events or coronary revascularization procedures among 937 patients , whereas in the simvastatin group ( n = 2221 ) , there were 1403 such hospitalizations ( average duration , 7.1 days ) among 720 patients ( all differences , P < .0001 ). The corresponding number of hospital days was 15089 and 9951 in the two groups , respectively ( 34 % reduction , P < .0001 ). In the United States , the resulting reduction in hospitalization costs over the 5.4 years of the trial would be $ 3872 per patient , reducing the effective cost of simvastatin by 88 % to $ 0.28 per day. In addition to reducing mortality and morbidity in coronary heart disease patients , simvastatin markedly reduces use of hospital services , thus offsetting most of its cost. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Glycine potentiates NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission , indicating that it may serve as an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia. Glycine was well tolerated , resulted in significantly increased serum glycine levels and induced a mean 36 ( 7 % ) reduction in negative symptoms ( P < 0.0001 ). Significant improvements were also induced in depressive and cognitive symptoms. The greatest reduction in negative symptoms was registered in the patients who had the lowest baseline serum glycine levels.

A few preclinical studies examined the pharmacological effects of varenicline , alone or in combination with nicotine. How varenicline affects the pharmacological effects of pure nicotine has not been examined in humans. The goal of this study was to characterize varenicline 's actions on nicotine 's dose-dependent effects in abstinent smokers. In response to IV nicotine , varenicline treatment attenuated the rating of drug strength , high , head rush , and stimulated. Varenicline also attenuated nicotine-induced increases in heart rate. Varenicline had mixed effects on cognitive performance. Smokers under varenicline treatment , compared with placebo , reported enhanced positive mood measured with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Eyes that had PRK had statistically significantly more residual myopia than RK-treated eyes at 3 , 6 , and 12 months postoperatively. This result was attributed to the use of an older excimer laser PRK algorithm that was used at the initiation of the study. No eye that had PRK was overcorrected by 0.50 D or more at 1 year postoperatively , while seven eyes that had RK were overcorrected by at least 0.50 D and six were overcorrected by 1.00 D. Eyes that had PRK had a statistically significant mean shift in the myopic direction between 6 and 12 months postoperatively ; two RK eyes had hyperopic shifts of 1.00 D. Three RK eyes and two PRK eyes failed to achieve an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better by 12 months postoperatively. No eye lost any best corrected visual acuity. The two procedures were comparably safe and effective in treating mild to moderate myopia under this protocol. Eyes that had PRK were somewhat more myopic at 1 year after surgery , attributable to the older PRK ablation algorithm. Adoption of newer ( current ) laser algorithms has improved the predictability of PRK. There was also evidence of reduced variability of outcome in the PRK group.

In this updated analysis of the entire patient cohort , we provide additional support for these findings and demonstrate that patients in the ICRF-187 group received more cycles ( median , 11 ) and higher cumulative doses ( median , 500 mg/m2 ) of doxorubicin than patients in the control group ( median , nine cycles , P less than .01 ; and 441 mg/m2 , P less than .05 ). Twenty-six patients in the ICRF-187 group received doxorubicin doses of at least 700 mg/m2 , and among them , 11 patients received 1,000 mg/m2 or more. Only three patients in the control group received doxorubicin doses of 700 mg/m2 ; the maximum dose administered to one patient in this group was 950 mg/m2. ICRF-187 cardiac protection was demonstrated by difference in incidence of clinical congestive heart failure ( CHF ; two patients in the ICRF-187 group v 20 in the control group ; P less than .0001 ) and by differences in resting left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) determined by multigated radionuclide ( MUGA ) scan from baselines and that required patient removal from study ( five patients in the ICRF-187 group had a decrease in LVEF to less than 0.45 or a decrease from the baseline LVEF of 0.20 or more v 32 in the control group ; P less than .000001 ).

ICRF-187 cardiac protection was observed in patients with and without prior chest-wall radiation or other risk factors for developing doxorubicin cardiac toxicity.

Metabolic bone activity in the adjacent femur was increased as a consequence of circular external skeletal fixator placement. Delayed-image bone scintigraphy was not adequately sensitive to quantitatively monitor bone formation but may be useful as an early predictor of bone healing. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

However , few studies have been naturalistic representations of how tea/coffee is normally consumed in terms of dose and time of consumption. Caffeinated beverages maintained CFF threshold over the whole day ( P < 0.05 ) , independent of caffeine dose or beverage type. During the acute phase of beverage ingestion , caffeine significantly sustained performance compared to water after the first beverage for CFF and subjective sedation ( P < 0.05 ) , and after the second beverage for the Recognition component of the CRT task ( P < 0.05 ). Additionally , there were significant differences between tea and coffee at 75 mg caffeine after the first drink. Compared to coffee , tea produced a significant increase in CFF threshold between 30 and 90 min post-consumption ( P < 0.01 ). However , following the second beverage caffeinated coffee at 75 mg significantly improved reaction time ( P < 0.05 ) , compared to tea at the same dose , for the Recognition component of the CRT task.

Retention rates were good for both groups-85 % for the Web-based group and 87 % for the print group. Subjects using the Web-based program performed significantly better than the print group on Attitudes Toward a Healthful Diet ( F ( 1,415 ) = 7.104 , P = .008 ) and Dietary Stage of Change ( F ( 1,408 ) = 6.487 , P = .01 ) , but there were no significant group differences on the five other dietary measures. Both groups also showed improvement from pretest to posttest on most dietary measures , as indicated by significant t tests. Within the Web-based group , dosage analyses showed significant effects of the number of times the subject accessed the program on measures of Dietary Self-Efficacy ( F ( 2,203 ) = 5.270 , P = .003 ) , Attitudes Toward a Healthful Diet ( F ( 2,204 ) = 2.585 , P = .045 ) , and Dietary Stage of Change ( F ( 2,200 ) = 4.627 , P = .005 ). No significant differences were found between the two groups on measures of stress or physical activity , although t tests of pretest-posttest changes indicated that both groups improved on several of these measures. The Web-based group gave significantly higher ratings to the program materials than the print group on all health topics and in their overall evaluation ( F ( 1,410 ) = 9.808 , P = .002 ). The Web-based program was more effective than print materials in producing improvements in the areas of diet and nutrition but was not more effective in reducing stress or increasing physical activity. The higher ratings given to the Web-based program suggest that workers preferred it to the print materials. Both groups showed numerous pretest-posttest improvements in all health topics , although such improvements might be attributable in part to a Hawthorne effect.

Aside from previous abdominal-surgery rates , 16 patients with laparoscopic-assisted sigmoid resections after re-establishing pneumoperitoneum and 15 patients with laparoscopic-assisted sigmoid resections with anastomosis performed in an open fashion through a horizontal suprapubic incision were well-matched for age , gender , weight , American Society of Anesthesiology class , previous admissions , skin-incision length , size of circular stapler , and mobilization of splenic flexure. There were no significant differences in morbidity rates ( 3/16 vs. 3/15 ) , complete doughnuts ( 16/16 vs. 15/15 ) , blood loss ( 300 vs. 200 ml ) , flatus ( 4 vs. 4 days ) , solid-food resumption ( 5 vs. 6 days ) , stay ( 8.5 vs. 9 days ) in laparoscopic-assisted sigmoid resection after re-establishing pneumoperitoneum and laparoscopic-assisted sigmoid resection with anastomosis performed in an open fashion through a horizontal suprapubic incision groups , respectively. Patients with laparoscopic-assisted sigmoid resection after re-establishing pneumoperitoneum had statistically longer operating room time ( 295 vs. 190 minutes ; P < 0.01 ). Median follow-up was 12 and 10 months in 10 patients with laparoscopic-assisted sigmoid resection after re-establishing pneumoperitoneum and 11 patients with laparoscopic-assisted sigmoid resection with anastomosis performed in an open fashion through a horizontal suprapubic incision , respectively. One patient with laparoscopic-assisted sigmoid resection with anastomosis performed in an open fashion through a horizontal suprapubic incision had an anastomotic stenosis endoscopically dilated. Nonrestoration of pneumoperitoneum after laparoscopic-assisted sigmoid resection allows a decrease in operating room time and a similar outcome. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Adenocarcinoma ( 53.9 % ) was the predominant histologic type ; 92 % of patients were in stage IV. The two groups were balanced for prognostic factors ; however , group A had fewer patients with significant weight loss and no patient with lung cancer as a second malignancy or after radiotherapy for brain metastases. Grade 3 or greater toxicity was rare : anemia in 0.8 and 3.2 % , neutropenia in 21.6 and 22.6 % , thrombocytopenia in 0 and 1.6 % , and nausea/vomiting in 4 and 8.1 % for arms A and B , respectively. Alopecia was seen in 54.5 % of patients in arm B , as compared with 9.7 % in arm A. No patient died of treatment-related toxicity. During cycle 5 , 47.7 % of patients in arm A and 60.7 % in arm B reported improved well-being , as compared with the status before chemotherapy. Patients in arm A had no complete remission , 32.8 % partial responses , 48 % minimal responses or stable disease , 13.6 % progressions , and 5.6 % were not evaluable. For arm B , the corresponding figures are as follows : complete remission 0.8 % , partial responses 46 % ( for overall response rate of 46.8 % ) , minimal responses or stable disease 36.3 % , progression 12.1 % , and not evaluable 4.8 %. Median progression-free survival was 5.5 and 6.0 months , median overall survival was 10.1 and 10.0 months , and 1-year survival was 46.6 and 41.1 % for arms A and B , respectively. For the 71 patients with squamous carcinoma , arm B seems superior to arm A , as seen by the higher overall response rate ( 51.3 versus 35.5 % ) , longer median progression-free survival ( 6.2 versus 4.9 months ) , and longer median survival ( 11.3 versus 8.5 months ).

The mean speed for the 15.2-m walk did not differ from that used for the 6-minute walk at 3 and 6 months but was significantly faster at 12 months. Differences became apparent at each assessment in patients in the highest quartiles ( > 1.0 m/s ) for the 15.2-m walk.

The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in which simvastatin reduced the risk of death by 30 % ( P = .0003 ) over the median follow-up period of 5.4 years in patients with previous myocardial infarction or stable angina pectoris as a result of a 42 % reduction in the risk of coronary deaths ( P = .00001 ). In the present report , data prospectively collected from hospital admissions were analyzed to evaluate the impact of simvastatin on healthcare resource use and perform a cost-minimization analysis. In the placebo group ( n = 2223 ) , there were 1905 hospitalizations ( average duration , 7.9 days ) for acute cardiovascular events or coronary revascularization procedures among 937 patients , whereas in the simvastatin group ( n = 2221 ) , there were 1403 such hospitalizations ( average duration , 7.1 days ) among 720 patients ( all differences , P < .0001 ). The corresponding number of hospital days was 15089 and 9951 in the two groups , respectively ( 34 % reduction , P < .0001 ). In the United States , the resulting reduction in hospitalization costs over the 5.4 years of the trial would be $ 3872 per patient , reducing the effective cost of simvastatin by 88 % to $ 0.28 per day. In addition to reducing mortality and morbidity in coronary heart disease patients , simvastatin markedly reduces use of hospital services , thus offsetting most of its cost. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Low-dose intradermal ( i.d. ) inoculations and supplementary intramuscular ( i.m. ) injections have been reported to improve the response rate in previous non-responder chronic uraemic patients , but no cost-effectiveness evaluations have been made about this issue. One month after completion of re-vaccination protocol , seroconversion rates ( 100 % vs 48 % , P = 0.008 ) and proportion of patients who elicited protective anti-HBs titres ( 96 % vs 40 % , P = 0.0001 ) were significantly higher in i.d. compared to i.m. patients. The levels of anti-HBs expressed as geometric mean titres and 95 % confidence intervals ( GMT ( 95 % CI ) ) , were significantly increased in i.d. than in i.m. groups , 100 ( 44-187 ) vs 26 ( 14-52 ) mUI/ml ( P = 0.018 ). At month 12 , the seroconversion rates were 57 vs 14 % in i.d. and i.m. groups respectively ( P = 0.158 ) ; the seroprotection rate was higher in i.d. individuals in comparison with i.m. patients , 50 vs 0 % , P = 0.072. At month 20 , the seroconversion rates were 54 and 0 % among i.d. and i.m. patients respectively ( P = 0.055 ) ; the seroprotection rate was higher in i.d. than in i.m. group ( 30 vs 0 % , P = 0.2 ). At month 20 , the median anti-HBs titres in i.d. patients were 21 mUI/ml , and GMT ( 95 % CI ) were 20.9 ( 2-54 ) mUI/ml. No important general or local side-effects were observed. The cost of our schedule was $ 92 US whereas the costs of other re-vaccination protocols ranged between 138 and $ 807 US. Our results show that the unresponsiveness to recombinant yeast-derived vaccine may be mostly reversed by repeated low-dose i.d. injections of the same agent. In spite of an equal amount of HBsAg received , i.d. hepatitis B re-vaccination shows higher immunogenicity compared to i.m. administration over a 20-month observation period. Cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated that the intradermal administration of HB vaccine is the most clinically effective re-vaccination strategy ; it is also the most unexpensive one. We strongly recommend low-dose intradermal inoculations in order to re-vaccinate chronic dialysis patients who fail to respond to hepatitis B vaccination. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

RC ( N = 90 , 35 % ) versus non-RC subjects ( N = 164 , 65 % ) were younger at intake ( p = .02 ) , less often psychotic ( p < .0001 ) , and more likely to have familial bipolar disorder ( p < .0001 ) , abused substances ( p = .01 ) , more previous hospitalizations ( p = .004 ) , and many more illness episodes ( p < .001 ). In initial blinded trial outcomes , relative responses ( > or = 50 % improvement of mania ) to olanzapine/placebo were similar in RC and non-RC subjects , though early responses to olanzapine favored RC over non-RC subjects ( p = .003 ) , and long-term outcomes favored non-RC subjects ( p = .05 ).

This result was attributed to the use of an older excimer laser PRK algorithm that was used at the initiation of the study. No eye that had PRK was overcorrected by 0.50 D or more at 1 year postoperatively , while seven eyes that had RK were overcorrected by at least 0.50 D and six were overcorrected by 1.00 D. Eyes that had PRK had a statistically significant mean shift in the myopic direction between 6 and 12 months postoperatively ; two RK eyes had hyperopic shifts of 1.00 D.

Three of 14 patients receiving the high-dose vaccine showed an increase in MART-1 - or gp100-specific T cells in the peripheral blood during vaccination. Six patients experienced disease-free survival for more than 5 years , and two of these patients developed vitiligo at multiple sites after vaccination. MART-1 - and gp100-specific T cells were found infiltrating in vitiligo skin. Upon vaccination , the T cells acquired an effector phenotype and produced interferon-gamma on specific antigenic stimulation. We conclude that vaccination with GM-CSF-transduced autologous tumor cells has limited toxicity and can enhance T-cell activation against melanocyte differentiation antigens , which can lead to vitiligo. Whether the induction of autoimmune vitiligo may prolong disease-free survival of metastatic melanoma patients who are surgically rendered as having no evidence of disease before vaccination is worthy of further investigation. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Repeated measures multivariate analyses revealed a significant treatment effect with subjects in the intervention group exercising more frequently , for longer duration , and walking greater distances over the course of the program. Path analysis indicated that the effect of the treatment on adherence was direct rather than through self-efficacy as hypothesized. Self-efficacy was , however , a significant predictor of exercise behavior in the early and middle stages of the exercise program but not during the last month. An intervention program designed to maximize information pertaining to participants ' capabilities appears to have had a reasonable effect on reducing attrition in middle-aged males and females and self-efficacy was a significant predictor of exercise frequency over time.

Physicians and third-party payers need to assess the economic impact of treatments that reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in which simvastatin reduced the risk of death by 30 % ( P = .0003 ) over the median follow-up period of 5.4 years in patients with previous myocardial infarction or stable angina pectoris as a result of a 42 % reduction in the risk of coronary deaths ( P = .00001 ). In the present report , data prospectively collected from hospital admissions were analyzed to evaluate the impact of simvastatin on healthcare resource use and perform a cost-minimization analysis. In the placebo group ( n = 2223 ) , there were 1905 hospitalizations ( average duration , 7.9 days ) for acute cardiovascular events or coronary revascularization procedures among 937 patients , whereas in the simvastatin group ( n = 2221 ) , there were 1403 such hospitalizations ( average duration , 7.1 days ) among 720 patients ( all differences , P < .0001 ). The corresponding number of hospital days was 15089 and 9951 in the two groups , respectively ( 34 % reduction , P < .0001 ).

Here , we evaluate the efficacy among HIV-infected women of a simpler , screen-and-treat strategy in which all women with a positive screening test are treated with cryotherapy. In the control group , HIV-positive women had higher rates of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher detected by 36 months ( 14.9 % ) than HIV-negative women ( 4.6 % ) ( P = 0.0006 ). Screen-and-treat utilizing human papillomavirus DNA testing significantly reduced cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher through 36 months in both HIV-positive ( relative risk = 0.20 , 95 % confidence interval 0.06-0 .69 ) and HIV-negative women ( relative risk = 0.31 , 95 % confidence interval 0.20-0 .50 ). Reductions in the visual inspection with acetic acid-and-treat group were less marked. Complications of cryotherapy were mostly minor and did not differ in frequency between HIV-positive and HIV-negative women.

The technique changes associated with power training were increases in magnitude of countermovement ( CMJ , DJ30 , DJ60 , and DJ90 ) and increases in ground contact time ( DJ30 and DJ60 ). In addition , the eccentric lower-limb stiffness produced during the countermovement phase of the jumps increased for CMJ and decreased for DJ30 , DJ60 , and DJ90. Stretching appeared to have no significant effect on CMJ or drop jump technique. The results of this study show that when the training goal is maximum jump height alone , it is likely that drop jump technique will change in the direction of a lower eccentric leg stiffness , greater depth of countermovement , and a longer ground contact time , whereas for a countermovement jump eccentric leg stiffness and the depth of countermovement will both increase.

No eye that had PRK was overcorrected by 0.50 D or more at 1 year postoperatively , while seven eyes that had RK were overcorrected by at least 0.50 D and six were overcorrected by 1.00 D. Eyes that had PRK had a statistically significant mean shift in the myopic direction between 6 and 12 months postoperatively ; two RK eyes had hyperopic shifts of 1.00 D. Three RK eyes and two PRK eyes failed to achieve an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better by 12 months postoperatively. No eye lost any best corrected visual acuity.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Respiratory function and pulmonary gas exchange are affected in laparoscopic procedures where a pneumoperitoneum is introduced using CO2. Previous studies have shown differing results concerning pulmonary gas exchange during laparoscopic procedures : Whereas in patients undergoing isoflurane anaesthesia decreases in PaO2 are demonstrated , this factor remains unchanged in patients undergoing propofol anaesthesia. In the present study , the effects of propofol on pulmonary gas exchange were compared with those of isoflurane in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a prospective randomised manner. Pulmonary gas exchange differed significantly after 30 min of PP between the IG and the PG. At this time , PaO2 was 19.5 + / - 2.9 kPa ( mean + / - SD ) in the IG and 23.1 + / - 1.8 kPa in the PG ( P < 0.01 ) , whereas PaCO2 was 5.5 + / - 0.37 kPa in the IG and 4.9 + / - 0.27 kPa in the PG ( P < 0.01 ). These discrepancies remained until after carbon dioxide desufflation. At 10 min post PP , PaO2 was 18.3 + / - 2.6 kPa in the isoflurane group and 21.9 + / - 2.2 kPa in the propofol group ( P < 0.01 ) , whereas PaCO2 was 5.4 + / - 0.46 kPa in the IG and 4.8 + / - 0.22 kPa in the PG ( P < 0.01 ). During carbon dioxide insufflation the P ( a-et ) CO2 increased significantly in the IG from 0.47 + / - 0.13 kPa to 0.76 + / - 0.37 kPa ( P < 0.05 ) , while the values in the PG remained constant. This study demonstrates that pulmonary gas exchange in patients with laparoscopic cholecystectomy is affected by the choice of anaesthetic procedure.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"A large subset of patients who enter treatment for alcohol dependence report nonabstinent drinking goals ( e.g. , reduction in drinking ) rather than abstinence , and this pretreatment goal choice may be associated with drinking outcomes and alcohol-related problems. Analyses revealed no interaction between the COMBINE experimental group and drinking goal on outcome measures , so results were collapsed and examined as a function of drinking goal group. Participants who chose an abstinent drinking goal had significantly more weeks with no drinking or no heavy drinking , reported fewer heavy drinking days , reported fewer days with > 1 drink , and were more likely to have a 50 % decrease in drinks per day between baseline and week 16 of the intervention. However , both groups reported reductions over time in percent drinking days , mean drinks per day , number of heavy drinking days , and number of drinking days per week , and participants in both groups experienced significant reductions in alcohol-related problems and improvements in psychosocial functioning. Results replicate and expand upon previous studies examining the association between drinking goal and treatment outcome. These data also provide support for the standard inclusion of drinking treatment goal as a stratification variable in study interventions or as a covariate in outcome analyses and highlight several areas that warrant additional research regarding patients who enter alcohol treatment with a nonabstinent drinking goal. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Among the 30 patients who had an assessable endomyocardial biopsy at cumulative doxorubicin 450 mg/m2 , none of 16 in the ICRF-187 group and six of 14 in the control group had a score of 2 ( P less than .05 ). ICRF-187 cardiac protection was observed in patients with and without prior chest-wall radiation or other risk factors for developing doxorubicin cardiac toxicity. By protecting against cumulative doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity , ICRF-187 permits significantly greater doses of doxorubicin to be administered to patients with greater safety. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

In initial blinded trial outcomes , relative responses ( > or = 50 % improvement of mania ) to olanzapine/placebo were similar in RC and non-RC subjects , though early responses to olanzapine favored RC over non-RC subjects ( p = .003 ) , and long-term outcomes favored non-RC subjects ( p = .05 ).

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Eyes that had PRK had statistically significantly more residual myopia than RK-treated eyes at 3 , 6 , and 12 months postoperatively. This result was attributed to the use of an older excimer laser PRK algorithm that was used at the initiation of the study. No eye that had PRK was overcorrected by 0.50 D or more at 1 year postoperatively , while seven eyes that had RK were overcorrected by at least 0.50 D and six were overcorrected by 1.00 D. Eyes that had PRK had a statistically significant mean shift in the myopic direction between 6 and 12 months postoperatively ; two RK eyes had hyperopic shifts of 1.00 D. Three RK eyes and two PRK eyes failed to achieve an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better by 12 months postoperatively. No eye lost any best corrected visual acuity. The two procedures were comparably safe and effective in treating mild to moderate myopia under this protocol. Eyes that had PRK were somewhat more myopic at 1 year after surgery , attributable to the older PRK ablation algorithm. Adoption of newer ( current ) laser algorithms has improved the predictability of PRK. There was also evidence of reduced variability of outcome in the PRK group.

This study was undertaken to assess the effects of a low-fat dietary pattern on incidence of treated diabetes among generally healthy postmenopausal women. Incident treated diabetes was reported by 1303 intervention participants ( 7.1 % ) and 2039 comparison participants ( 7.4 % ) ( hazard ratio , 0.96 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.90-1 .03 ; P = .25 ). Weight loss occurred in the intervention group , with a difference between intervention and comparison groups of 1.9 kg after 7.5 years ( P < .001 ). Subgroup analysis suggested that greater decreases in percentage of energy from total fat reduced diabetes risk ( P for trend = .04 ) , which was not statistically significant after adjusting for weight loss. A low-fat dietary pattern among generally healthy postmenopausal women showed no evidence of reducing diabetes risk after 8.1 years. Trends toward reduced incidence were greater with greater decreases in total fat intake and weight loss.

OS for ear melanoma was significantly impacted by ulceration status ( P = .013 ) , whereas both ulceration and SLN positivity predicted survival in nonear melanoma ( P < .001 and P = .015 , respectively ). Thicker melanomas in the nonear group demonstrated significantly decreased DFS , whereas other factors in both groups lost their predictive value ( P = .035 ). In the Sunbelt Melanoma Trial , ulceration was the strongest predictor of overall survival in melanoma of the ear. Ulceration and SLN status correlated with poorer OS in nonear melanoma of the H&N , whereas increasing depth correlated with poorer DFS in those same patients. Recurrence and survival were not impacted by anatomic site , but the prognostic significance of ulceration , thickness , and SLN status in the H&N may vary with the site of the melanoma. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Of 153 patients randomised to treatment , 82 ( 53.5 % ) were estimated to have complied satisfactorily with their treatment at the 1-year point. This had declined to 28 ( 18 % ) by the end of the 6-month follow-up period , during which support for the intervention had been removed and those wishing to continue exercise had to pay their own costs for maintaining their exercise treatment. High levels of co-morbidity were recorded in both groups. Nearly two thirds of all patients had a significant other illness in addition to their OA. Fifty-four control and 53 exercise patients had hospital inpatient episodes during the study period. Water exercise remained effective in the main study but overall effect size was small , on WOMAC pain at 1 year , a reduction of about 10 % in group mean pain score. This had declined , and was non-significant , at 18 months. Mean cost difference estimates showed a saving in the water exercise group of pound123 -- 175 per patient per annum and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from pound3838 to pound5951 per quality-adjusted life-year ( QALY ). Net reduction in pain was achieved at a net saving of pound135 -- 175 per patient per annum and the ceiling valuation of pound580 -- 740 per unit of WOMAC pain reduction was favourably low. Group-based exercise in water over 1 year can produce significant reduction in pain and improvement in physical function in older adults with lower limb OA , and may be a useful adjunct in the management of hip and/or knee OA. The water-exercise programme produced a favourable cost -- benefit outcome , using reduction in WOMAC pain as the measure of benefit. Further research is suggested into other similar public health interventions. Investigation is also needed into how general practice can best be supported to facilitate access to participants for research trials in healthcare , as well as an examination of the infrastructure and workforce capacities for physical activity delivery and the potential extent to which healthcare may be supported in this way.

The database from the Spinal Cord Injury Locomotor Trial ( SCILT ) , which tested 2 interventions for mobility upon admission for initial rehabilitation of an incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , was used to compare the walking speed employed for each test. The mean speed for the 15.2-m walk did not differ from that used for the 6-minute walk at 3 and 6 months but was significantly faster at 12 months. Differences became apparent at each assessment in patients in the highest quartiles ( > 1.0 m/s ) for the 15.2-m walk.

The present study incorporated a randomized control design in an effort to examine the effects of an efficacy-based intervention in enhancing exercise adherence in a large sample ( N = 114 ) of formerly sedentary middle-aged males and females. Repeated measures multivariate analyses revealed a significant treatment effect with subjects in the intervention group exercising more frequently , for longer duration , and walking greater distances over the course of the program. Path analysis indicated that the effect of the treatment on adherence was direct rather than through self-efficacy as hypothesized. Self-efficacy was , however , a significant predictor of exercise behavior in the early and middle stages of the exercise program but not during the last month. An intervention program designed to maximize information pertaining to participants ' capabilities appears to have had a reasonable effect on reducing attrition in middle-aged males and females and self-efficacy was a significant predictor of exercise frequency over time.

Of 153 patients randomised to treatment , 82 ( 53.5 % ) were estimated to have complied satisfactorily with their treatment at the 1-year point. This had declined to 28 ( 18 % ) by the end of the 6-month follow-up period , during which support for the intervention had been removed and those wishing to continue exercise had to pay their own costs for maintaining their exercise treatment. High levels of co-morbidity were recorded in both groups. Nearly two thirds of all patients had a significant other illness in addition to their OA. Fifty-four control and 53 exercise patients had hospital inpatient episodes during the study period. Water exercise remained effective in the main study but overall effect size was small , on WOMAC pain at 1 year , a reduction of about 10 % in group mean pain score. This had declined , and was non-significant , at 18 months. Mean cost difference estimates showed a saving in the water exercise group of pound123 -- 175 per patient per annum and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from pound3838 to pound5951 per quality-adjusted life-year ( QALY ). Net reduction in pain was achieved at a net saving of pound135 -- 175 per patient per annum and the ceiling valuation of pound580 -- 740 per unit of WOMAC pain reduction was favourably low. Group-based exercise in water over 1 year can produce significant reduction in pain and improvement in physical function in older adults with lower limb OA , and may be a useful adjunct in the management of hip and/or knee OA. The water-exercise programme produced a favourable cost -- benefit outcome , using reduction in WOMAC pain as the measure of benefit. Further research is suggested into other similar public health interventions. Investigation is also needed into how general practice can best be supported to facilitate access to participants for research trials in healthcare , as well as an examination of the infrastructure and workforce capacities for physical activity delivery and the potential extent to which healthcare may be supported in this way.

In this updated analysis of the entire patient cohort , we provide additional support for these findings and demonstrate that patients in the ICRF-187 group received more cycles ( median , 11 ) and higher cumulative doses ( median , 500 mg/m2 ) of doxorubicin than patients in the control group ( median , nine cycles , P less than .01 ; and 441 mg/m2 , P less than .05 ). Twenty-six patients in the ICRF-187 group received doxorubicin doses of at least 700 mg/m2 , and among them , 11 patients received 1,000 mg/m2 or more. Only three patients in the control group received doxorubicin doses of 700 mg/m2 ; the maximum dose administered to one patient in this group was 950 mg/m2. ICRF-187 cardiac protection was demonstrated by difference in incidence of clinical congestive heart failure ( CHF ; two patients in the ICRF-187 group v 20 in the control group ; P less than .0001 ) and by differences in resting left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) determined by multigated radionuclide ( MUGA ) scan from baselines and that required patient removal from study ( five patients in the ICRF-187 group had a decrease in LVEF to less than 0.45 or a decrease from the baseline LVEF of 0.20 or more v 32 in the control group ; P less than .000001 ).

ICRF-187 cardiac protection was observed in patients with and without prior chest-wall radiation or other risk factors for developing doxorubicin cardiac toxicity.

It was hypothesised that the airway response to inhaled allergen after exposure to a combination of 400 ppb nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) and 200 ppb sulphur dioxide ( SO2 ) is increased 24-48 hours after exposure. Exposure to 400 ppb NO2 + 200 ppb SO2 significantly decreased the dose of D pteronyssinus allergen required to produce a 20 % fall in FEV1 ( PD20FEV1 ) at all times after exposure when compared with air. The mean percentage changes in allergen PD20FEV1 immediately , 24 hours , and 48 hours after exposure to 400 ppb NO2 + 200 ppb SO2 were -37 % ( 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) -50 to -23 ) , -63 % ( CI -75 to -51 ) , and -49 % ( CI -75 to -28.8 ) , respectively , when compared with the PD20FEV1 after air exposure and were significant at all time points studied. The allergen PD20FEV1 at 24 hours after exposure to the combination of the two pollutants was also found to be significantly lower when compared with that immediately after exposure to the two pollutants. These results demonstrate that exposure to a combination of NO2 and SO2 , at concentrations which can be encountered during episodes of increased outdoor and indoor air pollution , enhances the airway response to inhaled allergen in asthmatic subjects.

None of the patients vomited or received antiemetic medication during the 24 hours postdischarge period. Ninety-seven percent of patients receiving propofol alone and all of the patients in the propofol-N2O group were `` very satisfied '' with their anesthetic experience. In outpatients undergoing office-based surgical procedures with propofol anesthesia , administration of 65 % N2O decreased the anesthetic requirement without increasing PONV.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Elevated baseline levels of B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) and the N-terminal fragments of its prohormone , N-terminal-pro-BNP ( NT-proBNP ) , have been associated with adverse long-term outcome in patients with acute coronary syndromes , whereas the prognostic implications of serial NT-proBNP measurements have not been investigated to date. NT-proBNP , troponin T , and C-reactive protein were measured at baseline and at 48 and 72 hours in 1791 patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes. Death and myocardial infarction were recorded during 30 days of follow-up. After adjustment for independent predictors of cardiac risk , baseline NT-proBNP levels > 250 ng/L were associated with higher event rates ( adjusted OR , 3.7 ; 95 % CI , 2.3 to 5.7 ; P < 0.001 ). In troponin T-negative patients , NT-proBNP identified a subgroup of high-risk patients ( OR , 5.9 ; 95 % CI , 2.6 to 13.3 ; P < 0.001 ). The risk in those patients ( 7.2 % ) did not significantly differ from that in troponin T-positive patients ( 9.8 % ; P = 0.25 ). Importantly , clinical stabilization without refractory ischemia was associated with a rapid ( as soon as 48 hours after onset of symptoms ) and significant ( 48 hours ; -24 % ; 72 hours , -49 % ; both P < 0.001 ) decline in NT-proBNP levels. In patients with high NT-proBNP baseline levels , lack of a rapid decline in NT-proBNP levels ( < or = 250 ng/L ) was linked to an adverse short-term prognosis ( OR , 33.7 ; 95 % CI , 8.2 to 138.8 ; P < 0.001 ). In patients with low NT-proBNP baseline levels , a rise in NT-proBNP levels over 72 hours to > 250 ng/L was also linked to an adverse 30-day prognosis ( OR , 24.0 ; 95 % CI , 8.4 to 68.5 ; P < 0.001 ). Neurohumoral activation as evidenced by NT-proBNP appears as a unifying feature that is independent of other biochemical markers ( myocardial necrosis , inflammation ) and is a powerful and independent determinant of the short-term cardiac risk in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Whether serial measurements of NT-proBNP in patients with ACS may be used to more rapidly identify patients suitable for early discharge or more intensive therapy deserves future prospective studies. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

However , the influence of telomere lengths of specific chromosomal arms on the breast cancer risk is unknown. Telomere length on chromosome 9p was significantly shorter in breast cancer patients than in control subjects ( P < 0.001 ). Using the 50th percentile value in controls as a cut point , women who have short 9p telomeres had an increased risk of breast cancer [ adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) = 2.6 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 1.5-4 .3 ].

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"The results provided support for the motivation matching hypothesis in the out-patient sample and among females in the aftercare sample : the majority of individuals with lower baseline motivation had better outcomes if assigned to motivation enhancement treatment ( MET ) compared to those assigned to cognitive behavioral treatment ( CBT ). In the aftercare sample there was a moderating effect of gender and alcohol dependence severity , whereby males with lower baseline motivation and greater alcohol dependence drank more frequently if assigned to MET compared to those assigned to CBT. Results from the current study lend partial support to the motivation-matching hypothesis and also demonstrated the importance of moderating influences on treatment matching effectiveness. Based upon these findings , individuals with low baseline motivation in out-patient settings and males with low levels of alcohol dependence or females in aftercare settings may benefit more from motivational enhancement techniques than from cognitive-behavioral techniques. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

The cough is present during the day, especially after returning from school. His school teacher says he does not cough at school. The cough is absent while he is asleep, although it increases during examinations or when he experiences boredom. His mother reports that there was a one-month period where he did not cough, but during that month, he used to shrug his shoulders frequently, especially when he was stressed or fatigued. There is no history of sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, headache, ear symptoms, or breathing difficulty. Detailed history does not suggest the presence of a mood disorder, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. There is no past history of a known neurological disorder, and there is no history of substance abuse. On physical examination, his vital signs are stable. Examination of his respiratory and cardiovascular systems is normal. However, the pediatrician notes repeated eye blinking; upon asking about eye blinking, the mother reports that he has had this habit since he was almost eight years old. Further inquiry suggests that eye blinking, coughing, and grunting disappear for a few weeks without explanation, only to reappear again. Which of the following drugs is likely to be most effective to control this patient\u2019s symptoms?\n (A) Atomoxetine\n (B) Clonidine\n (C) Fluoxetine\n (D) Haloperidol\n (E) Levetiracetam</QUESTION>\n<ANSWER>  (B) Clonidine</ANSWER>.

Despite clinical evidence for the efficacy of a - noradrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol in the alleviation of anxiety symptoms and the secondary prevention of post traumatic stress disorder , preclinical evidence for a - noradrenergic modulation of BLA activity in humans is missing. Consistent with our a priori hypothesis , propranolol diminished BLA responses to facial expressions , independent of their emotional valence. The absence of activity changes in probabilistically defined visual control regions underscores the specific action of propranolol in the BLA. Our findings provide the missing link between the anxiolytic potential of propranolol and the biological basis of - noradrenergic activation in the human BLA as a key target for the pharmacological inhibition of anxiety neurocircuitry.

Mean + / - SD saliva output was greater during transdermal than extended-release oral treatment ( 15.7 + / - 93 vs 12.2 + / - 6.8 g , respectively ; P = .02 ). Lower N-desethyloxybutynin during transdermal application was associated with greater saliva output ( r = -059 , P = .04 ). No clinically important treatment-related adverse effects were observed. Transdermal oxybutynin administration results in greater systemic availability and minimizes metabolism to N-desethyloxybutynin compared with extended-release oral administration. Lower N-desethyloxybutynin plasma concentration and greater saliva output during transdermal treatment correspond to the reported low incidence of dry mouth in patients with overactive bladder. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Meta-analyses suggest that conventional inactivated influenza vaccines are of low efficacy in young children , making vaccines that induce greater and broader immune protection in this vulnerable population a medical priority. Adjuvanted influenza vaccines may offer a solution. Clinical tolerability and safety were generally comparable between vaccine groups , though some transient , mild solicited reactions were more frequent in the Sub/MF59 group. Postvaccination hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers to all 3 vaccine strains were significantly higher with Sub/MF59 than with split vaccine ( all comparisons P < 0.001 ) after each of the 3 vaccine doses. In addition , Sub/MF59 induced significantly higher cross-reactivity against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 mismatched strains. MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine was well tolerated in healthy young children after each of 3 doses and induced greater , longer-lasting , and broader immune responses than a nonadjuvanted split vaccine.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) reduce CMRGlc to varying degrees. Phenobarbital causes a mean decrease of 30 to 40 %. Phenytoin , carbamazepine ( CBZ ) , and valproate ( VPA ) cause milder reductions in CMRGlc. The combination of VPA with CBZ results in a greater decrease than either drug alone. The effect of novel AEDs on both CBF and CMRGlc has not been studied extensively. No statistically significant difference in age , duration of epilepsy , or CBZ levels was observed in the two patient groups. VGB reduced global CMRGlc by 8.1 + / -6.5 % and global CBF by 13.1 + / -10.4 %. The change in CMRGlc was different in patients taking VGB compared with those on PLC ( p < 0.04 ). VGB patients showed regional decreases in both CMRGlc and CBF , particularly in temporal lobes. CSF total GABA increased in the VGB patient group ( 1.48 + / -1.06 versus 4.03 + / -4.19 nm/mL ). The increase differed from the PLC group ( p < 0.03 ). We found a strong relation between decreased total CSF GABA and increased CMRGlc in the VGB patient group ( R2 = 0.82 , p < 0.01 ). Vigabatrin ( VGB ) causes mild reductions in both cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) and cerebral metabolic rate for glucose ( CMRGlc ) in contrast to other drugs such as barbiturates , which are direct agonists at the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine receptor complex. Conventional AEDs depress CBF and CMRGlc to a greater degree than does VGB. The relatively mild reduction could be due to pre - as well as postsynaptic effects or a use-dependent mechanism. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

This result was attributed to the use of an older excimer laser PRK algorithm that was used at the initiation of the study. No eye that had PRK was overcorrected by 0.50 D or more at 1 year postoperatively , while seven eyes that had RK were overcorrected by at least 0.50 D and six were overcorrected by 1.00 D. Eyes that had PRK had a statistically significant mean shift in the myopic direction between 6 and 12 months postoperatively ; two RK eyes had hyperopic shifts of 1.00 D. Three RK eyes and two PRK eyes failed to achieve an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better by 12 months postoperatively. No eye lost any best corrected visual acuity. The two procedures were comparably safe and effective in treating mild to moderate myopia under this protocol.

However , their effect on memory for emotionally laden stimuli has been relatively neglected. As expected , the emotional memory advantage was retained for recall and recognition memory under placebo conditions. However , lorazepam and scopolamine produced anterograde recognition memory impairments on both the neutral and emotional components of the narrative , although floor effects were obtained for recall memory. Furthermore , compared with placebo , recognition memory for both central ( gist ) and peripheral ( detail ) aspects of neutral and emotional elements of the narrative was poorer after either drug. Benzodiazepine-induced GABAergic enhancement or scopolamine-induced cholinergic hypofunction results in a loss of the enhancing effect of emotional arousal on memory. Furthermore , lorazepam - and scopolamine-induced memory impairment for both gist ( which is amygdala dependent ) and detail raises the possibility that their effects on emotional memory do not depend only on the amygdala.

Physicians and third-party payers need to assess the economic impact of treatments that reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in which simvastatin reduced the risk of death by 30 % ( P = .0003 ) over the median follow-up period of 5.4 years in patients with previous myocardial infarction or stable angina pectoris as a result of a 42 % reduction in the risk of coronary deaths ( P = .00001 ). In the present report , data prospectively collected from hospital admissions were analyzed to evaluate the impact of simvastatin on healthcare resource use and perform a cost-minimization analysis. In the placebo group ( n = 2223 ) , there were 1905 hospitalizations ( average duration , 7.9 days ) for acute cardiovascular events or coronary revascularization procedures among 937 patients , whereas in the simvastatin group ( n = 2221 ) , there were 1403 such hospitalizations ( average duration , 7.1 days ) among 720 patients ( all differences , P < .0001 ). The corresponding number of hospital days was 15089 and 9951 in the two groups , respectively ( 34 % reduction , P < .0001 ). In the United States , the resulting reduction in hospitalization costs over the 5.4 years of the trial would be $ 3872 per patient , reducing the effective cost of simvastatin by 88 % to $ 0.28 per day. In addition to reducing mortality and morbidity in coronary heart disease patients , simvastatin markedly reduces use of hospital services , thus offsetting most of its cost. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

The relationship between eGFR and the outcome of death or HF was attenuated by including baseline differences in LVMI , and both LVMI and LA volume conferred additional prognostic information in a multivariable model.

Whether interleukin 28B ( IL28B ) single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) genotypes and on-treatment viral responses can identify non-rapid virological response ( RVR ) patients who benefit from 48 or 72 weeks of therapy remains unclear. Treatment duration , IL28B rs8099917 genotypes , cirrhosis , week-8 viral response ( undetectable HCV RNA at treatment week 8 ) and complete early virological response ( cEVR ) predicted SVR.

This result was attributed to the use of an older excimer laser PRK algorithm that was used at the initiation of the study. No eye that had PRK was overcorrected by 0.50 D or more at 1 year postoperatively , while seven eyes that had RK were overcorrected by at least 0.50 D and six were overcorrected by 1.00 D. Eyes that had PRK had a statistically significant mean shift in the myopic direction between 6 and 12 months postoperatively ; two RK eyes had hyperopic shifts of 1.00 D. Three RK eyes and two PRK eyes failed to achieve an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better by 12 months postoperatively. No eye lost any best corrected visual acuity. The two procedures were comparably safe and effective in treating mild to moderate myopia under this protocol. Eyes that had PRK were somewhat more myopic at 1 year after surgery , attributable to the older PRK ablation algorithm. Adoption of newer ( current ) laser algorithms has improved the predictability of PRK. There was also evidence of reduced variability of outcome in the PRK group.

In this updated analysis of the entire patient cohort , we provide additional support for these findings and demonstrate that patients in the ICRF-187 group received more cycles ( median , 11 ) and higher cumulative doses ( median , 500 mg/m2 ) of doxorubicin than patients in the control group ( median , nine cycles , P less than .01 ; and 441 mg/m2 , P less than .05 ). Twenty-six patients in the ICRF-187 group received doxorubicin doses of at least 700 mg/m2 , and among them , 11 patients received 1,000 mg/m2 or more. Only three patients in the control group received doxorubicin doses of 700 mg/m2 ; the maximum dose administered to one patient in this group was 950 mg/m2. ICRF-187 cardiac protection was demonstrated by difference in incidence of clinical congestive heart failure ( CHF ; two patients in the ICRF-187 group v 20 in the control group ; P less than .0001 ) and by differences in resting left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) determined by multigated radionuclide ( MUGA ) scan from baselines and that required patient removal from study ( five patients in the ICRF-187 group had a decrease in LVEF to less than 0.45 or a decrease from the baseline LVEF of 0.20 or more v 32 in the control group ; P less than .000001 ). Among the 30 patients who had an assessable endomyocardial biopsy at cumulative doxorubicin 450 mg/m2 , none of 16 in the ICRF-187 group and six of 14 in the control group had a score of 2 ( P less than .05 ). ICRF-187 cardiac protection was observed in patients with and without prior chest-wall radiation or other risk factors for developing doxorubicin cardiac toxicity. By protecting against cumulative doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity , ICRF-187 permits significantly greater doses of doxorubicin to be administered to patients with greater safety. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

At the first screen most cancers found by the additional core were clinically relevant. In later screens these cancers seemed to be minimal. The performance of TRUS as a screening tool is poor. The value of the additional core was limited as only 3.5 % of the visible cancers were detected solely by the additional biopsy ( round 1 ). However , a substantial part of these cancers were clinically relevant and would have been missed without the additional biopsy.

The intraocular pressure ( IOP ) is typically higher than the level considered statistically normal. Although there is no known cure , appropriate reduction of IOP with hypotensive drugs ( eg , the topical prostaglandin analogue travoprost ) delays the progression of POAG. Chemical-stability studies of travoprost performed by the manufacturer suggest that the stability of travoprost is maintained beyond the expiration date , which is 6 weeks after the laminated packaging has been opened. : Thirty-one patients completed the study ( 55 eyes ; 28 right and 27 left eyes ; 35 eyes of women , 20 eyes of men ). The mean ( SD ) ages of the opened and control groups were 61.8 ( 13.5 ) and 62.8 ( 14.1 ) years , respectively. Twenty-four patients were included in both treatment groups ( ie , 1 eye per group ). The baseline IOP was similar between the 2 treatment groups. There was a significant reduction in IOP in both groups at 4 and 6 weeks ( both , P < 0.001 vs baseline ). However , no significant differences in IOP were found between the 2 treatment groups at any time during the study. Conjunctive hyperemia and a burning sensation in the eye immediately after application were the only AEs reported ; the incidence of these was similar between the 2 treatment groups.

In comprehensive sensitivity analyzes , the robustness of the model and its results was shown. First , the impact of the model parameters on the target variable for each patient group was quantified in a deterministic model. Secondly , the dependency of the target variable on random variables was described for each patient group using Monte Carlo simulation. Irrespective of the patient group , the cost weight and the base rate of hospitals for inpatient ECV in phase I turned out to have the greatest impact on the savings obtained by the enoxaparin-based regimen. In the case of patients with any CCL , this impact was about 1.4-fold of that of the probability of enoxaparin patients undergoing outpatient ECV in phase I. In the case of low-risk patients , the impact of the cost weight and the base rate of hospitals for inpatient ECV in phase I was about 4.1-fold of that of the price of enoxaparin 60 mg prefilled syringes in the outpatient sector.

Glycine potentiates NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission , indicating that it may serve as an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia. Glycine was well tolerated , resulted in significantly increased serum glycine levels and induced a mean 36 ( 7 % ) reduction in negative symptoms ( P < 0.0001 ). Significant improvements were also induced in depressive and cognitive symptoms. The greatest reduction in negative symptoms was registered in the patients who had the lowest baseline serum glycine levels. These results extend previous findings and suggest an additional approach to the pharmacotherapy of negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP-4 ) inhibitors are proposed to lower blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) by prolonging the activity of the circulating incretins , glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) and glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ). Consistent with this mechanism of action , DPP-4 inhibitors improve glucose tolerance after meals by increasing insulin and reducing glucagon levels in the plasma. However , DPP-4 inhibitors also reduce fasting blood glucose , an unexpected effect because circulating levels of active GIP and GLP-1 are low in the postabsorptive state. There were small and comparable reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin in both groups over 3 months. Vildagliptin increased fasting GLP-1 levels in subjects taking metformin , but not those managed with diet , and raised active GIP levels slightly. DPP-4 inhibitor treatment improved the acute insulin and C-peptide responses to glucose ( 50 and 100 % respectively ; P < 0.05 ) and increased the slope of the C-peptide response to glucose ( 33 % ; P = 0.023 ). Vildagliptin improves islet function in T2DM under fasting conditions. This suggests that DPP-4 inhibition has metabolic benefits in addition to enhancing meal-induced GLP-1 and GIP activity. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

In this updated analysis of the entire patient cohort , we provide additional support for these findings and demonstrate that patients in the ICRF-187 group received more cycles ( median , 11 ) and higher cumulative doses ( median , 500 mg/m2 ) of doxorubicin than patients in the control group ( median , nine cycles , P less than .01 ; and 441 mg/m2 , P less than .05 ).

Only three patients in the control group received doxorubicin doses of 700 mg/m2 ; the maximum dose administered to one patient in this group was 950 mg/m2. ICRF-187 cardiac protection was demonstrated by difference in incidence of clinical congestive heart failure ( CHF ; two patients in the ICRF-187 group v 20 in the control group ; P less than .0001 ) and by differences in resting left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) determined by multigated radionuclide ( MUGA ) scan from baselines and that required patient removal from study ( five patients in the ICRF-187 group had a decrease in LVEF to less than 0.45 or a decrease from the baseline LVEF of 0.20 or more v 32 in the control group ; P less than .000001 ).

The two procedures were comparably safe and effective in treating mild to moderate myopia under this protocol. Eyes that had PRK were somewhat more myopic at 1 year after surgery , attributable to the older PRK ablation algorithm. Adoption of newer ( current ) laser algorithms has improved the predictability of PRK. There was also evidence of reduced variability of outcome in the PRK group. The PRK eyes did not exhibit hyperopic shifts during the 1 year follow-up. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

For the surgical treatments , bone height was increased in the test group treated with hyaluronan ( mean value 2.2 % , corresponding to an average increase of approximately 0.5 mm ) and reduced in the control group ( mean value -1.8 % , corresponding to an average decrease of approximately - 0.4 mm ) ( P < 0.05 ) after 12 months. For the non-surgical treatments , bone height was reduced by a mean value of -1.1 % ( corresponding to an average decrease of approximately -0.25 mm ) in the test group treated with hyaluronan and -3.3 % ( corresponding to an average decrease of approximately -0.75 mm ) in the control group after 12 months ( N.S. ). According to the digital color-coded radiographs , the test sites in the surgical and non-surgical groups showed apposition of bone minerals. Immune responses showed no differences during the 12 months studied for the surgical and non-surgical sites. Mean periodontal probing depths were reduced between 2.5 mm and 4.1 mm in the surgical and non-surgical groups. The observed difference in bone height between test and control sites in the surgical group after 12 months was less than 1 mm , which was only detectable on radiographs. No statistical difference was found on radiographs in the non-surgical group , where a decrease in bone height was found for both groups after scaling. Probing depth reduction after the surgical treatment , as well as after scaling and root planing , was as expected. Hyaluronan in contact with bone and soft tissues had no influence on the immune system in this study. Further studies are needed to determine the extent to which hyaluronan can lead to clinically significant healing of periodontal lesions. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Despite clinical evidence for the efficacy of a - noradrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol in the alleviation of anxiety symptoms and the secondary prevention of post traumatic stress disorder , preclinical evidence for a - noradrenergic modulation of BLA activity in humans is missing. Consistent with our a priori hypothesis , propranolol diminished BLA responses to facial expressions , independent of their emotional valence. The absence of activity changes in probabilistically defined visual control regions underscores the specific action of propranolol in the BLA. Our findings provide the missing link between the anxiolytic potential of propranolol and the biological basis of - noradrenergic activation in the human BLA as a key target for the pharmacological inhibition of anxiety neurocircuitry.

Early and late recovery variables were similar in the two treatment groups ; however , 65 % N2O produced a 19 % decrease in the propofol maintenance dosage requirement. One patient ( 3 % ) experienced nausea prior to discharge in the propofol-N2O group , and two patients ( 6 % ) experienced nausea at home in the propofol alone group. None of the patients vomited or received antiemetic medication during the 24 hours postdischarge period. Ninety-seven percent of patients receiving propofol alone and all of the patients in the propofol-N2O group were `` very satisfied '' with their anesthetic experience. In outpatients undergoing office-based surgical procedures with propofol anesthesia , administration of 65 % N2O decreased the anesthetic requirement without increasing PONV.

The relative AUC0t and Cmax ratios for the MLR methylphenidate formulation compared with the OROS methylphenidate formulation were 110.88 % and 121.84 % , respectively. When OROS methylphendate values were dose normalized to 20 mg , the relative AUC0-t and Cmax ratios were 100.72 % and 111.82 %. The mean Tmax for the 2 formulations was 3.71 ( 2.03 ) and 4.96 ( 2.56 ) hours. Values were significantly higher with the MLR methylphenidate formulation compared with the OROS methylphenidate formulation for AUC ( 0-4 ) ( P < 0.001 ) , AUC ( 0-8 ) ( P < 0.001 ) , AUC ( 0-12 ) ( P < 0.001 ) , and AUC ( 4-12 ) ( P = 0.037 ) ; the AUC ( 8-12 ) was not significantly different between the 2 formulations. Values were significantly higher for the MLR methylphenidate formulation relative to the OROS methylphenidate formulation for C ( max0-4 ) ( P < 0.001 ) and C ( max4-12 ) ( P = 0.002 ). Thirty-seven adverse events occurred in 11 and 10 subjects during receipt of MLR and OROS methylphenidate , respectively.

In these healthy young subjects , MLR methylphenidate was associated with a concentration-time profile that resulted in a higher proportion of the administered methylphenidate dose being delivered in the first 4 hours after dosing compared with OROS methylphenidate while maintaining comparable levels of drug in the latter portion of the dosing interval. This led to maintenance of higher mean levels of methylphenidate throughout the day compared with the closest marketed dose of OROS methylphenidate.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Eyes that had PRK had statistically significantly more residual myopia than RK-treated eyes at 3 , 6 , and 12 months postoperatively. This result was attributed to the use of an older excimer laser PRK algorithm that was used at the initiation of the study. No eye that had PRK was overcorrected by 0.50 D or more at 1 year postoperatively , while seven eyes that had RK were overcorrected by at least 0.50 D and six were overcorrected by 1.00 D. Eyes that had PRK had a statistically significant mean shift in the myopic direction between 6 and 12 months postoperatively ; two RK eyes had hyperopic shifts of 1.00 D. Three RK eyes and two PRK eyes failed to achieve an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better by 12 months postoperatively. No eye lost any best corrected visual acuity. The two procedures were comparably safe and effective in treating mild to moderate myopia under this protocol. Eyes that had PRK were somewhat more myopic at 1 year after surgery , attributable to the older PRK ablation algorithm. Adoption of newer ( current ) laser algorithms has improved the predictability of PRK. There was also evidence of reduced variability of outcome in the PRK group.

Physicians and third-party payers need to assess the economic impact of treatments that reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in which simvastatin reduced the risk of death by 30 % ( P = .0003 ) over the median follow-up period of 5.4 years in patients with previous myocardial infarction or stable angina pectoris as a result of a 42 % reduction in the risk of coronary deaths ( P = .00001 ). In the present report , data prospectively collected from hospital admissions were analyzed to evaluate the impact of simvastatin on healthcare resource use and perform a cost-minimization analysis. In the placebo group ( n = 2223 ) , there were 1905 hospitalizations ( average duration , 7.9 days ) for acute cardiovascular events or coronary revascularization procedures among 937 patients , whereas in the simvastatin group ( n = 2221 ) , there were 1403 such hospitalizations ( average duration , 7.1 days ) among 720 patients ( all differences , P < .0001 ). The corresponding number of hospital days was 15089 and 9951 in the two groups , respectively ( 34 % reduction , P < .0001 ).

Vigabatrin ( VGB ) causes mild reductions in both cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) and cerebral metabolic rate for glucose ( CMRGlc ) in contrast to other drugs such as barbiturates , which are direct agonists at the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine receptor complex. Conventional AEDs depress CBF and CMRGlc to a greater degree than does VGB. The relatively mild reduction could be due to pre - as well as postsynaptic effects or a use-dependent mechanism. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Levo-acetyl-alpha-methadol ( LAAM ) exerts most of it mu-agonist activity through the action of its 2 N-demethylation metabolites , norLAAM and dinorLAAM. The N-demethylation of LAAM to norLAAM and norLAAM to dinorLAAM is primarily performed by cytochrome P450s ( CYP ) in the 3A family. No previous studies have been conducted to determine the effect of in vivo inhibition of CYP3A on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LAAM. Results are presented as the geometric mean with 90 % confidence intervals of individual ratios of ketoconazole to placebo sessions. Coadministration of ketoconazole and LAAM resulted in a 3.22-fold ( 2.53-4 .10 , P < .001 ) and 5.29-fold ( 4.24-6 .61 , P < .001 ) increase in the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) and area under the curve ( AUC ) of LAAM. The values for time to Cmax ( tmax ) of norLAAM and dinorLAAM were increased 2.43-fold ( 1.92-3 .08 , P < .001 ) and 11.6-fold ( 8.36-16 .1 , P < .001 ) , with 0.77-fold ( 0.67-0 .87 , P < .005 ) and 0.55-fold ( 0.49-0 .60 , P < .001 ) decreases in their respective Cmax values. The AUCs of norLAAM and dinorLAAM were increased 2.25-fold ( 1.96-2 .58 , P < .001 ) and 1.21-fold ( 1.12-1 .32 , P < .005 ) , respectively. Pupil diameter was significantly decreased by LAAM after both placebo and ketoconazole pretreatment ; ketoconazole increased the tmax for miosis 2.92-fold ( 2.01-4 .25 , P < .001 ). Other physiologic measures and numerous subjective effects measures were significantly affected by LAAM ; however , few significant effects of ketoconazole pretreatment were observed on these outcomes. A single dose of ketoconazole causes a significant pharmacokinetic drug interaction with a single dose of LAAM that results in increased LAAM concentrations relative to norLAAM and dinorLAAM at early time points. Coadministration also results in prolongation of the appearance of its active metabolites and a concomitant prolongation of miosis , a sensitive dynamic index of mu-opioid action. The clinically relevant increase in LAAM concentrations and prolongation of plasma LAAM metabolites may affect physiologic function , such as QT intervals , suggesting that coadministration of LAAM and CYP3A4 inhibitors should be contraindicated. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Animal models of anxiety disorders emphasize the crucial role of locus ceruleus-noradrenergic ( norepinephrine , NE ) signaling , the basolateral amygdala ( BLA ) and their interactions in the expression of anxiety-like behavioral responses to stress. Despite clinical evidence for the efficacy of a - noradrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol in the alleviation of anxiety symptoms and the secondary prevention of post traumatic stress disorder , preclinical evidence for a - noradrenergic modulation of BLA activity in humans is missing. Consistent with our a priori hypothesis , propranolol diminished BLA responses to facial expressions , independent of their emotional valence. The absence of activity changes in probabilistically defined visual control regions underscores the specific action of propranolol in the BLA. Our findings provide the missing link between the anxiolytic potential of propranolol and the biological basis of - noradrenergic activation in the human BLA as a key target for the pharmacological inhibition of anxiety neurocircuitry. Moreover , our findings add to emerging evidence that NE modulates both the reactivity ( sensitivity ) and the operating characteristics ( specificity ) of the BLA via - noradrenergic receptors. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

At 1-year follow-up , both the combined 24-week treatment and CBT alone were significantly superior in reducing binge eating to desipramine given for 16 weeks. The combined treatment was also superior to 16 weeks of desipramine in reducing emotionally driven eating and dietary restraint. Only 18 % ( 2 of 11 ) of those receiving 16 weeks of desipramine were free of binge eating and purging at follow-up compared with 78 % ( 7 of 9 ) of those receiving the combined 24-week treatment. The other groups fell between these two extremes. With the exception of the group treated for 16 weeks with desipramine alone , maintenance of improvement appeared satisfactory with all the treatments. Since the poorest results were found with 16 weeks of desipramine treatment , this study suggests that desipramine should be continued for at least 24 weeks either alone or combined with CBT. The broadest gain in reducing the psychopathology associated with bulimia nervosa was found with the combined 24-week treatment. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Recent studies have suggested that air pollutants resulting from vehicle exhaust emissions and burning of fossil fuels , either in combination or individually , may enhance the airway response of asthmatic subjects to inhaled allergen. It was hypothesised that the airway response to inhaled allergen after exposure to a combination of 400 ppb nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) and 200 ppb sulphur dioxide ( SO2 ) is increased 24-48 hours after exposure. Exposure to 400 ppb NO2 + 200 ppb SO2 significantly decreased the dose of D pteronyssinus allergen required to produce a 20 % fall in FEV1 ( PD20FEV1 ) at all times after exposure when compared with air. The mean percentage changes in allergen PD20FEV1 immediately , 24 hours , and 48 hours after exposure to 400 ppb NO2 + 200 ppb SO2 were -37 % ( 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) -50 to -23 ) , -63 % ( CI -75 to -51 ) , and -49 % ( CI -75 to -28.8 ) , respectively , when compared with the PD20FEV1 after air exposure and were significant at all time points studied. The allergen PD20FEV1 at 24 hours after exposure to the combination of the two pollutants was also found to be significantly lower when compared with that immediately after exposure to the two pollutants. These results demonstrate that exposure to a combination of NO2 and SO2 , at concentrations which can be encountered during episodes of increased outdoor and indoor air pollution , enhances the airway response to inhaled allergen in asthmatic subjects.

Although these programs have typically been delivered through combinations of seminars and print materials , workplace health promotion programs are increasingly being delivered through the Internet. Retention rates were good for both groups-85 % for the Web-based group and 87 % for the print group. Subjects using the Web-based program performed significantly better than the print group on Attitudes Toward a Healthful Diet ( F ( 1,415 ) = 7.104 , P = .008 ) and Dietary Stage of Change ( F ( 1,408 ) = 6.487 , P = .01 ) , but there were no significant group differences on the five other dietary measures. Both groups also showed improvement from pretest to posttest on most dietary measures , as indicated by significant t tests. Within the Web-based group , dosage analyses showed significant effects of the number of times the subject accessed the program on measures of Dietary Self-Efficacy ( F ( 2,203 ) = 5.270 , P = .003 ) , Attitudes Toward a Healthful Diet ( F ( 2,204 ) = 2.585 , P = .045 ) , and Dietary Stage of Change ( F ( 2,200 ) = 4.627 , P = .005 ). No significant differences were found between the two groups on measures of stress or physical activity , although t tests of pretest-posttest changes indicated that both groups improved on several of these measures. The Web-based group gave significantly higher ratings to the program materials than the print group on all health topics and in their overall evaluation ( F ( 1,410 ) = 9.808 , P = .002 ). The Web-based program was more effective than print materials in producing improvements in the areas of diet and nutrition but was not more effective in reducing stress or increasing physical activity. The higher ratings given to the Web-based program suggest that workers preferred it to the print materials. Both groups showed numerous pretest-posttest improvements in all health topics , although such improvements might be attributable in part to a Hawthorne effect. Results suggest that a multimedia Web-based program can be a promising means of delivering health promotion material to the workforce , particularly in the area of diet and nutrition. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

This pilot study was designed to explore the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial of a mindfulness intervention to reduce antenatal depression , anxiety and stress. Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12613000742774 ( 31/10/2012 ). 20 women were recruited to the non-randomised trial , and 32 to the RCT. Recruitment through a mailed study brochure at the time of booking-in to the hospital resulted in the largest number of participants in the RCT ( 16/32 ; 50 % ) , and resulted in considerably earlier recruitment ( 50 % in first trimester , 50 % second trimester ) compared to recruitment through the antenatal clinic waiting room ( 86 % in second trimester , 14 % third trimester ). Over a third of women in the universal population scored above clinical cut-offs for depression and anxiety , indicating a sample with more symptomology than the general population. The most common reason for loss to follow-up was delivery of baby prior to follow-up ( n = 9 ). In the non-randomised study , significant within group improvements to depression and anxiety were observed. In the intervention arm of the RCT there were significant within group improvements to anxiety and mindfulness. No between group differences for the intervention and ` care as usual ' control group were observed.

This result was attributed to the use of an older excimer laser PRK algorithm that was used at the initiation of the study. No eye that had PRK was overcorrected by 0.50 D or more at 1 year postoperatively , while seven eyes that had RK were overcorrected by at least 0.50 D and six were overcorrected by 1.00 D. Eyes that had PRK had a statistically significant mean shift in the myopic direction between 6 and 12 months postoperatively ; two RK eyes had hyperopic shifts of 1.00 D. Three RK eyes and two PRK eyes failed to achieve an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better by 12 months postoperatively. No eye lost any best corrected visual acuity. The two procedures were comparably safe and effective in treating mild to moderate myopia under this protocol. Eyes that had PRK were somewhat more myopic at 1 year after surgery , attributable to the older PRK ablation algorithm. Adoption of newer ( current ) laser algorithms has improved the predictability of PRK. There was also evidence of reduced variability of outcome in the PRK group.

Therefore the project for advancing the health of newborns and mothers ( Projahnmo ) implemented a community-based intervention package through government and non-government organisation infrastructures to reduce neonatal mortality. The number of clusters per arm was eight. The number of participants was 36059 , 40159 , and 37598 in the home-care , community-care , and comparison arms , respectively , with 14 769 , 16 325 , and 15 350 livebirths , respectively. In the last 6 months of the 30-month intervention , neonatal mortality rates were 29.2 per 1000 , 45.2 per 1000 , and 43.5 per 1000 in the home-care , community-care , and comparison arms , respectively. Neonatal mortality was reduced in the home-care arm by 34 % ( adjusted relative risk 0.66 ; 95 % CI 0.47-0 .93 ) during the last 6 months versus that in the comparison arm. No mortality reduction was noted in the community-care arm ( 0.95 ; 0.69-1 .31 ). A home-care strategy to promote an integrated package of preventive and curative newborn care is effective in reducing neonatal mortality in communities with a weak health system , low health-care use , and high neonatal mortality. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

He says that the pain is primarily located in his knees and occurs in sharp bursts that are accompanied by redness and warmth. His past medical history is significant for diabetes though he is not currently taking any medications. He also suffers from occasional diarrhea with fatty stools. Physical exam reveals mild swelling and redness in his knees bilaterally. Furthermore, he is found to be very tan despite the fact that he says he stays out of the sun. He notes that he has always been significantly more tan than anyone else in his family.

The following chunks were retrieved from biomedical literature to help you:\n\"Recovery times and the incidences of PONV were recorded during the first 24 hours after surgery. Early and late recovery variables were similar in the two treatment groups ; however , 65 % N2O produced a 19 % decrease in the propofol maintenance dosage requirement. One patient ( 3 % ) experienced nausea prior to discharge in the propofol-N2O group , and two patients ( 6 % ) experienced nausea at home in the propofol alone group. None of the patients vomited or received antiemetic medication during the 24 hours postdischarge period. Ninety-seven percent of patients receiving propofol alone and all of the patients in the propofol-N2O group were `` very satisfied '' with their anesthetic experience. In outpatients undergoing office-based surgical procedures with propofol anesthesia , administration of 65 % N2O decreased the anesthetic requirement without increasing PONV. Therefore , use of a propofol-N2O combination may be a cost-effective alternative to propofol alone for office-based anesthesia. \",\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

He mentions that over the last month he has been having difficulty breathing, especially after climbing stairs. He also says that he has had similar episodes in the past, which were relieved with the use of inhaled bronchodilators, but recently the breathlessness has ceased to respond to them. He also mentions frequent pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. On physical examination, his temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), the pulse is 96/min, the blood pressure is 124/82 mm Hg, and the respirations are 26/min. Auscultation of the chest reveals wheezing bilaterally and a loud pulmonic component of the second heart sound. Two-dimensional echocardiography shows a dilated right ventricle with increased wall thickness. Right heart catheterization is performed, which indicates a pulmonary artery pressure of 30 mm Hg and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 13 mm Hg. There is a significant drop in pulmonary artery pressure after the administration of inhaled nitric oxide. In addition to continued appropriate management of chronic bronchitis, which of the following medications is most likely to improve symptoms in the patient?\n (A) Captopril\n (B) Diltiazem\n (C) Hydralazine\n (D) Isosorbide mononitrate\n (E) Losartan</QUESTION>\n<ANSWER>  (D) Isosorbide mononitrate</ANSWER>.
