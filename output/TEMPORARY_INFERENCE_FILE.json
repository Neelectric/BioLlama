Physical examination shows moist palms and a nontender thyroid gland that is enlarged to two times its normal size. Ophthalmologic examination shows prominence of the globes of the eyes, bilateral lid retraction, conjunctival injection, and an inability to converge the eyes. There is no pain on movement of the extraocular muscles. Visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally. Neurologic examination shows a fine resting tremor of the hands. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ with a shortened relaxation phase.
