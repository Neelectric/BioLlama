Thus , they are more likely to be exposed to vitamin D supplementation and thiazide diuretics .\nBACKGROUND\tThe risk for hypercalcemia among blacks using vitamin D and hydrochlorothiazide is undefined .\nMETHODS\tWe assessed the frequency of hypercalcemia in hydrochlorothiazide users in a post hoc analysis of a randomized , double-blind , dose-finding trial of 328 blacks ( median age 51 years ) assigned to either placebo , or 1000 , 2000 , or 4000 international units of cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) daily for 3 months during the winter ( 2007-2010 ) .\nRESULTS\tOf the 328 participants , 84 reported hydrochlorothiazide use and had serum calcium levels assessed .\nRESULTS\tAdditionally , a comparison convenience group of 44 enrolled participants who were not taking hydrochlorothiazide had serum calcium measurements at 3 months , but not at baseline .\nRESULTS\tAt 3 months , hydrochlorothiazide participants had higher calcium levels ( 0.2 mg/dL , P < .001 ) than nonhydrochlorothiazide participants , but only one participant in the hydrochlorothiazide group had hypercalcemia .\nRESULTS\tIn contrast , none of the nonhydrochlorothiazide participants had hypercalcemia .\nRESULTS\tIn a linear regression model adjusted for age , sex , 25-hydroxyvitamin D at 3 months , and other covariates , only hydrochlorothiazide use ( Estimate [ SE ] : 0.05 [ 0.01 ] , P = .01 ) predicted serum calcium at 3 months .\nCONCLUSIONS\tIn summary , vitamin D3 supplementation up to 4000 IU in hydrochlorothiazide users is associated with an increase in serum calcium but a low frequency of hypercalcemia .\nCONCLUSIONS\tThese findings suggest that participants of this population can use hydrochlorothiazide with up to 4000 IU of vitamin D3 daily and experience a low frequency of hypercalcemia .\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION> Which of the following is not true for myelinated nerve fibers: \n(1) Impulse through myelinated fibers is slower than non-myelinated fibers \n(2) Membrane currents are generated at nodes of Ranvier \n(3) Saltatory conduction of impulses is seen \n(4) Local anesthesia is effective only when the nerve is not covered by myelin sheath</QUESTION>\n<ANSWER> 3</ANSWER>\nSelect the correct choice for the following question.

Restriction to confirmed AMI yielded a greater risk and these associations remained consistent with adjustment of smoking status , body mass index and psychosocial work factors including job demands , job control , workplace justice , job insecurity and shift work .\nCONCLUSIONS\tThe results support the hypothesis that long working hours and short sleep duration contribute independently to the risk of cardiovascular diseases in men .\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION> Which of the following is not true for myelinated nerve fibers: \n(1) Impulse through myelinated fibers is slower than non-myelinated fibers \n(2) Membrane currents are generated at nodes of Ranvier \n(3) Saltatory conduction of impulses is seen \n(4) Local anesthesia is effective only when the nerve is not covered by myelin sheath</QUESTION>\n<ANSWER> 3</ANSWER>\nSelect the correct choice for the following question.
