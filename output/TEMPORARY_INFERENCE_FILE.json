We performed primary stenting and stem cell transplantion in 16 patients who received a BMS ( n = 8 ) or an SES ( n = 8 ). In 2 patients with a BMS , late stent thrombosis occurred after 58 d and 177 d , respectively. In the remaining patients , control angiography after 6 mo revealed in-stent restenosis of > 50 % in no patients with SES but in 4 patients with BMS ( 67 % ). Late lumen loss and in-stent plaque volume were significantly higher in patients with BMS compared with patients with SES. Compared with BMS , SES impair in-stent intima hyperplasia after stenting for acute myocardial infarction and transcoronary transplantation of G-CSF mobilized ASC. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>Orteronel was developed for treatment of which cancer?</QUESTION>\n<ANSWER> castration-resistant prostate cancer</ANSWER>\nYou must now answer the following biomedical question AS SUCCINCTLY AS YOU CAN.

Intention-to-treat and per-protocol ( > 85 % compliance ) analyses showed no significant effect of fish oil treatment on any lipid , inflammatory , hemostatic , or composite mood parameters measured. Adherence to treatment based on pill count was good ( 89 % ) reflected by increased serum docosahexanoic acid ( P < 0.001 ) and eicosapentaenoic acid ( P = 0.0006 ) in the fish oil group. Analysis of oil composition , however , showed some degradation and potentially adverse oxidation products at the end of the study. There was no effect of 12 weeks of treatment with moderate-dose fish oil supplements on cardiovascular biomarkers or mood in patients with ischemic stroke. It is possible that insufficient dose , short duration of treatment , and/or oxidation of the fish oils may have influenced these outcomes. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>Orteronel was developed for treatment of which cancer?</QUESTION>\n<ANSWER> castration-resistant prostate cancer</ANSWER>\nYou must now answer the following biomedical question AS SUCCINCTLY AS YOU CAN.
