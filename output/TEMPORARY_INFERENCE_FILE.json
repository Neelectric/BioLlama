Changes of cardiac function and hemodynamics were monitored using thoracic electrical bio-impedance method at different time points of operation , i.e. the baseline before induction ( T0 ) , after induction when loss of consciousness ( T1 ) , during intubation ( T2 ) , beginning of operation ( T3 ) , ending of operation ( T4 ) , during extubation ( T5 ) and 10 min after extubation ( T6 ) .\nRESULTS\tNo significant difference between the two groups was found in operation lasting time and anesthesia maintaining time ( P > 0.05 ) .\nRESULTS\tThe amount of vecuronium bromide consumed in an unit of time in Group B was significantly lower than that in Group A ( P < 0.05 ) .\nRESULTS\tThe mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , heart rate ( HR ) , rate pressure product ( RPP ) , cardiac output ( CO ) , systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) , and blood flow acceleration index ( ACI ) in Group A at T1 were all significantly lower ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) , but became significantly higher at T2 and T5 as compared with those of baseline ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) , while no significant change of them was found in Group B.
