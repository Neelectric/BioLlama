Prospective , randomized , double-blind clinical trial. University referral center ; ENT Department. Fourty one children , aged 4-16 years , undergoing tonsillectomy. Patients received 1.0 % ropivacaine hydrochloride soaked swabs packed in their tonsillar fossae while the control group received saline-soaked swabs. Mc Grath 's face scale was used to compare the two groups in respect of pain control. Chi-square and two-tailed unpaired Student 's t-tests or Mann-Whitney-U-tests were used to compare the two independent groups. As 10 we made 11 comparison between groups , for Bonferroni correction , p < 0.005 was accepted as statistically significant. Only first hour there was no significant pain-relieving effect seen in the ropivacaine group ( p > 0.05 ). The other hours and days there were statistically significance between the two groups ( p < 0.001 ). Also , the other post-operative parameters such as nausea , fever , vomiting , odor , bleeding , otalgia and trismus were not statistically different between the two groups. There were no complications associated with ropivacaine hydrochloride. No patients in this study suffered systemic side effects related to the use of this medication. Locally 1.0 % ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and , it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

A golden angle radial sequence ( GOLD ) was validated in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments and clinical feasibility was shown in two studies. The impact of free breathing and image plane orientation on T1 values was evaluated in a controlled in vivo experiment. The free-breathing GOLD sequence was compared against a standard breath-hold gradient echo sequence for gastric half emptying time in 23 subjects during a gastric emptying study. Pilot data from five subjects assessed the sensitivity of the GOLD sequence to detect changes in acid secretion volume produced by PPI treatment. The coronal free-breathing GOLD sequence and the axial breath-hold standard gradient echo sequence showed good agreement of the gastric half emptying time ( 6 3 min , P = 0.053 ). The GOLD sequence demonstrated sensitivity to reduction of gastric secretion volumes induced by PPI treatment ( 55 5 mL , P < 0.001 ). The GOLD sequence allowed for free breathing , multislice , combined imaging and T1 mapping of the stomach content.

The present study is the first experimental trial , to our knowledge , of whether regular volunteering can reduce cardiovascular risk factors in adolescents. To test a novel intervention that assigned adolescents to volunteer with elementary school-aged children as a means of improving adolescents ' cardiovascular risk profiles. Randomized controlled trial , with measurements taken at baseline and 4 months later ( postintervention ). Urban public high school in western Canada. One hundred six 10th-grade high school students who were fluent in English and free of chronic illnesses. Weekly volunteering with elementary school-aged children for 2 months vs wait-list control group. Cardiovascular risk markers of C-reactive protein level , interleukin 6 level , total cholesterol level , and body mass index. No statistically significant group differences were found at baseline. Postintervention , adolescents in the intervention group showed significantly lower interleukin 6 levels ( log10 mean difference , 0.13 ; 95 % CI , 0.004 to 0.251 ) , cholesterol levels ( log10 mean difference , 0.03 ; 95 % CI , 0.003 to 0.059 ) , and body mass index ( mean difference , 0.39 ; 95 % CI , 0.07 to 0.71 ) compared with adolescents in the control group. Effects for C-reactive protein level were marginal ( log10 mean difference , 0.13 ; 95 % CI , -0.011 to 0.275 ). Preliminary analyses within the intervention group suggest that those who increased the most in empathy and altruistic behaviors , and who decreased the most in negative mood , also showed the greatest decreases in cardiovascular risk over time. Adolescents who volunteer to help others also benefit themselves , suggesting a novel way to improve health.

Forty cases with respiration and cardiac arrest in the department of critical care medicine were randomly divided into low VT ventilation group and conventional VT group. Both groups were given the volume control mode. In the low VT ventilation group , VT was set on 6 - 7 ml/kg , and high pressure alarm threshold was adjusted to 60 cm H2O by the conventional 40 cm H2O during CPR. In the conventional VT group , VT and high pressure alarm threshold were set at 8 - 12 ml/kg and 40 cm H2O , respectively. Real-time actual VT , peak inspiratory pressure ( PIP ) , and arterial blood gas test , blood lactic acid at 10 minutes and 30 minutes after CPR were observed. At 10 minutes after CPR , in the low VT ventilation group , arterial blood pH , arterial partial pressure of oxygen ( PaO2 ) , arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( PaCO2 ) , HCO3 ( - ) , arterial oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) and blood lactic acid were better as compared with those in the conventional VT ventilation group ( pH : 7.210.09 vs. 7.130.07 , PaO2 : 45.355.92 mm Hg vs. 40.704.70 mm Hg , PaCO2 : 57.107.59 mm Hg vs. 61.605.47 mm Hg , HCO3 ( - ) : 18.503.50 mmol/L vs. 14.752.65 mmol/L , SaO2 : 0.7960.069 vs. 0.6990.066 , blood lactic acid : 7.071.60 mmol/L vs. 8.131.56 mmol/L , all P < 0.05 ).

We hypothesize that a forearm rescue cuff is better tolerated than the traditional rescue cuff of a double-cuff tourniquet. After Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval and informed consent , 10 healthy unmedicated volunteers took part in a prospective , randomized , cross-over study. Following inflation of the proximal tourniquet cuff on the upper arm , a standardized IVRA with 0.5 % lidocaine , 0.6 mL/kg was administered. When the volunteer complained of tourniquet pain , or at 30 minutes , the initial cuff was changed to a rescue cuff. During session A , the rescue cuff was the traditional distal cuff of the double-cuff tourniquet. During session B , a single forearm cuff was used. When the volunteer experienced the same level of tourniquet pain , the rescue cuff was deflated and the study session ended. The tourniquet time for the rescue cuff , the visual analog scale ( VAS ) pain score , and the incidence and duration of side effects were recorded. The forearm rescue cuff was tolerated significantly longer than the arm rescue cuff ( 49 + / - 15 v 29 + / - 11 minutes , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 7 to 32 minutes , P < / = .005 ). When the forearm rescue cuff was used , VAS scores were lower and side effects were of shorter duration ( 6 + / - 5 v 15 + / - 7 minutes , P < .001 ). A forearm rescue cuff is better tolerated than an arm cuff double tourniquet during IVRA , allowing for longer tourniquet times.

We sought to determine the dose-related efficacy and onset of action of the HDM sublingual immunotherapy tablet MK-8237 ( Merck/ALK-Abell ) using the Vienna Challenge Chamber. In this randomized , double-blind , single-site trial , adults with HDM-induced allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis and with or without asthma ( n = 124 ) received 12 developmental units ( DU ) of MK-8237 , 6 DU of MK-8237 , or placebo daily for 24 weeks. Subjects underwent 6-hour exposure challenges at screening and weeks 8 , 16 , and 24. The total nasal symptom score ( TNSS ) during chamber challenge at week 24 was the primary end point. The TNSS was the sum of 4 nasal symptom scores ( maximum = 12 ). Total ocular symptom scores ( TOSSs ; 2 symptoms ; maximum = 6 ) and total symptom scores ( TSSs ; TSS = TNSS plus TOSS ; maximum = 18 ) were secondary end points. Dose - and time-dependent improvements with MK-8237 versus placebo were observed. At week 24 , TNSS improvement relative to placebo was 48.6 % ( 95 % CI , 35.3 % to 60.2 % ) with 12 DU of MK-8237 and 26.6 % ( 95 % CI , 11.2 % to 39.6 % ) with 6 DU of MK-8237. Statistically significant improvements for TNSSs were also observed at weeks 8 ( 12 DU of MK-8237 ) and 16 ( 6 and 12 DU of MK-8237 ) and for TOSSs and TSSs by both doses at week 24. MK-8237 was well tolerated. No investigator-assessed anaphylactic allergic reactions or reactions requiring epinephrine were observed. MK-8237 , 12 DU , reduced nasal and ocular symptoms and exceeded World Allergy Organization-established clinical efficacy criteria ( 20 % improvement vs placebo ). The onset of action for 12 DU of MK-8237 was week8.MK-8237 , 12 DU , is appropriate for further evaluation to determine the magnitude of effect in an uncontrolled allergenexposure environment. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

In this article , we describe the sonographic findings in subjects infected with attenuated , monovalent strains of dengue virus. As part of a major research protocol to validate challenge strains of dengue virus for use in vaccines , 12 subjects were infected with 1 of 4 strains of dengue virus , and 3 subjects received placebo. The challenge was followed by an observation period. During this time , they were imaged regardless of the development of symptoms. Seven of 12 subjects infected with dengue virus showed sonographic evidence of subclinical plasma leakage , including perihepatic and perisplenic ascites , pericardial effusion , and gallbladder wall thickening. None of the 3 placebo recipients developed effusions. Sonographic evidence of fluid collection was seen in over half of subjects infected with dengue virus who did not show any evidence of dengue hemorrhagic fever.

Limited information is available regarding the effects of PRT on lean and fat mass in frail elderly persons. Ninety-one community-dwelling sedentary men and women , 78 years and older with physical frailty ( defined using standardized objective criteria ) were enrolled in a 9-month trial of exercise training ( ET ). Physical frailty was defined as having 2 of the 3 following criteria : modified Physical Performance Test score between 18 and 32 , peak aerobic power between 10 and 18 ml/kg/min , or self-report of difficulty or assistance with two instrumental activities of daily living or one basic activity of daily living. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control ( CTL ) group that performed a low intensity home exercise program or a supervised ET group that performed 3 months of low intensity exercise and 3 months of PRT. After completion of PRT , ET participants had greater improvements than did CTL participants in maximal voluntary force production for knee extension ( mean Delta +5.3 + / - 13 ft/lb vs +1.1 + / - 11 ft/lb , p = .05 ) , measured using isokinetic dynamometry. Total body FFM ( measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ) increased in the ET group , but not in the CTL group ( mean Delta +0.84 + / - 1.4 kg vs +0.01 + / - 1.5 kg , p = .005 ).

These studies used a highly selected population of patients and providers , and their results may not be generalizable to actual care. Our goal in this study was to compare long-term survival of MVD patients treated with CABG vs PCI in contemporary practice. From our northern New England registries of consecutive coronary revascularizations , we identified 10,198 CABG and 4,295 PCI patients with MVD who may have been eligible for either procedure between 1994 and 2001. Vital status was obtained by linkage to the National Death Index. Proportional-hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios ( HRs ) for survival in CABG vs PCI patients after adjustment for comorbidities and disease characteristics. CABG patients were older ; had more comorbidities , more 3-vessel disease , and lower ejection fractions ; and were more completely revascularized. Adjusted long-term survival for patients with 3-vessel disease was better after CABG than PCI ( HR , 0.60 ; P < 0.01 ) but not for patients with 2-vessel disease ( HR , 0.98 ; P = 0.77 ). The survival advantage of CABG for 3-vessel disease patients was present in all patient populations , including women , diabetics , and the elderly and in the era of high stent utilization. In contemporary practice , survival for patients with 3-vessel coronary disease is better after CABG than PCI , an observation that patients and physicians should carefully consider when deciding on a revascularization strategy. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Randomized prospective study. Patients undergoing their first IVF treatment were randomized into two groups. The ultrasound only group ( study group ) was monitored by US for follicle size and endometrial thickness without blood tests. In this group , only one blood test was taken before human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) injection , to ensure a safe level of estradiol ( E ( 2 ) ) regarding ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) risk. The control group was monitored by ultrasound plus serum estradiol and progesterone concentration at each visit. Clinical pregnancy rate. No differences were found between the groups in the parameters of IVF treatment , induction days , number of ampoules , E ( 2 ) level of hCG , as well as embryo quality. The clinical pregnancy rate was not statistically different between the groups , 57.5 % vs. 40.0 % , respectively ( p = 0.25 ). No OHSS cases were found among the study or control groups.

An observational , cross-sectional study at The Northem General Hospital , Sheffield , UK. Sixty-eight women born at Jessop Hospital , Sheffield , between 1952 and 1953 were divided into four groups according to the status of their polycystic ovaries and body mass index : either > or approximately 25. Therefore , this was an unselected sample , unlike previous studies that have recruited from endocrine clinics or similar. Subjects underwent pelvic ultrasonography to visualize their ovaries in order to diagnose or exclude polycystic ovaries. They all underwent a short insulin tolerance test. Women with a body mass index > 25 and with polycystic ovaries were the most insulin resistant. Women with a body mass index of < or =. 25 and with normal ovaries were the most insulin sensitive. Women with a body mass index < or =. 25 and polycystic ovaries were the more resistant than those with a body mass index > 25 and with normal ovaries.

We assessed the extent by which it can refine risk classification for overall survival ( OS ) and LRR in patients with head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ). EGFR expression in locally advanced HNSCC was measured by immunohistochemistry in a series of patients randomized to receive accelerated or conventional radiation regimens in a Phase III trial. Subsequently , data of the two series were pooled ( N = 533 ) for conducting a recursive partitioning analysis that incorporated clinical parameters ( e.g. , performance status , primary site , T and N categories ) and four molecular markers ( EGFR , p53 , Ki-67 , and microvessel density ). This study confirmed that patients with higher than median levels of tumor EGFR expression had a lower OS ( relative risk [ RR ] : 1.90 , p = 0.0010 ) and a higher LRR ( RR : 1.91 , p = 0.0163 ). Of the four markers analyzed , only EGFR was found to contribute to refining classification of patients into three risk classes with distinct OS and LRR outcomes. The addition of EGFR to three clinical parameters could identify patients having up to a fivefold difference in the risk of LRR. Adding pretreatment EGFR expression data to known robust clinical prognostic variables improved the estimation of the probability for OS and LRR after radiotherapy. Its use for stratifying or selecting patients with defined tumor feature and pattern of relapse for enrollment into clinical trials testing specific therapeutic strategy warrants further investigation. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

In this study named StratHegy patients ( n = 287 ) were randomized to receive one of three empirical triple therapy regimens or a strategy based on antibiotic susceptibility. The empirical regimens were omeprazole , 20 mg b.d. , plus amoxicillin , 1000 mg b.d. , and clarithromycin , 500 mg b.d. , for 7 days ( OAC7 ) , clarithromycin , 500 mg b.d. , for 14 days ( OAC14 ) or metronidazole , 500 mg b.d. , for 14 days ( OAM14 ). In the susceptibility-based strategy , patients with clarithromycin-susceptible strains received OAC14 , whilst the others received OAM14. The 13C-urea breath test was performed before randomization and 4-5 weeks after eradication therapy. In the intention-to-treat analysis , the eradication rates for empirical therapies were as follows : OAC7 , 47.4 % ( 27/57 ) ; OAC14 , 34.5 % ( 20/58 ) ; OAM14 , 63.2 % ( 36/57 ) ; it was 74.3 % ( 84/113 ) for the susceptibility-based treatment ( P < 0.01 when compared with OAC7 and OAC14 ). In patients receiving clarithromycin , the eradication rates were 80 % for clarithromycin-susceptible strains and 16 % for clarithromycin-resistant strains ; in patients receiving OAM14 , the eradication rates were 81 % for metronidazole-susceptible strains and 59 % for metronidazole-resistant strains. Eradication rates of approximately 75 % can be achieved with second-line triple therapy based on antibiotic susceptibility testing.

We sought to determine whether a weekly dose of alendronate , an oral bisphosphonate , could reduce this unwanted side-effect. To assess whether once-weekly oral alendronate therapy would maintain or improve BMD in men initiating ADT for localised PCa. A multicentre , double-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled study , we included hormonally nave PCa patients initiating ADT with leuprolide acetate 30 mg intramuscularly every 4 mo.. Patients were randomised to receive either oral alendronate 70 mg once weekly or placebo for 1 yr. Both groups received daily calcium 1g and vitamin D 400 international units. Changes in BMD ( at the lumbar spine [ LS ] and total hip [ TH ] ) and bone markers. One hundred ninety-one subjects were enrolled , and 186 were randomised between alendronate ( n = 84 ) and placebo ( n = 102 ). The alendronate group demonstrated a mean spine BMD increase of 1.7 % compared with -1.9 % in the placebo group ( p < 0.0001 ). Alendronate also increased the BMD at the hip ( percent change : 0.7 % ) compared to placebo ( -1.6 % ). Median urinary N-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type I collagen ( Ntx ) values decreased by 3.5 % in the alendronate group and increased by 16.5 % in the placebo arm , even after adjusting for centre ( p = 0.510 ) and baseline urinary Ntx ( p < 0.0001 ). Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase ( BSAP ) decreased a median of 2.25 % in the alendronate group and increased a median of 3.12 % in the placebo arm , regardless of centre or baseline BSAP or other covariates ( p < 0.0001 ). The safety and tolerability profile was similar for the two treatment groups. Although the study was closed early because of slow accrual , it showed that weekly oral alendronate prevented bone loss and increased bone mass in addition to decreasing bone turnover in patients initiating ADT for localised PCa , with few related side-effects. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Recently , research interest has focused on modification of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) levels for the potential prevention of cardiovascular events. The effects of pitavastatin and atorvastatin on HDL-C have not been directly compared. This study compared the effects of pitavastatin and atorvastatin on HDL-C and other lipids and glucose metabolism in Japanese patients with elevated LDL-C levels and glucose intolerance. The tolerability of the 2 treatments was also compared. This was a multicenter , open-label , parallel-group trial. Patients with LDL-C levels > or = 140 mg/dL and glucose intolerance ( defined according to Japanese criteria for borderline diabetes and World Health Organization criteria for impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance ) were randomly assigned to receive either pitavastatin 2 mg/d or atorvastatin 10 mg/d for 52 weeks. Levels of serum lipids and lipoproteins and measures of glucose metabolism ( fasting insulin , fasting glucose , glycosylated hemoglobin , and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance ) were obtained at baseline and at 8 , 26 , and 52 weeks of treatment. The effect of study drug on glucose metabolism was evaluated as a tolerability outcome. Tolerability was further assessed based on adverse events , either spontaneously reported or elicited by questioning ; physical examination findings ; and clinical laboratory test results. Study physicians rated the relationship of adverse events to study medication as unrelated , suspected , or probable. Two hundred seven patients were enrolled in the study , and efficacy was evaluated in 173 patients ( 88 pitavastatin , 85 atorvastatin ). Thirty-four patients were excluded for reasons including failure to start medication or lack of > or = 6 months of follow-up. Women accounted for 62 % ( 108/173 ) of the evaluable population , which had a mean age of 63.3 years and a mean weight of 63.0 kg ; 89 % ( 154/173 ) had diabetes mellitus. The percent change in HDL-C levels was significantly greater in the pitavastatin group compared with the atorvastatin group ( 8.2 vs 2.9 , respectively ; P = 0.031 ) , as was the percent change in apolipoprotein ( Apo ) A-I ( 5.1 vs 0.6 ; P = 0.019 ). The percent change in LDL-C levels was significantly lower with atorvastatin compared with pitavastatin ( -40.1 vs -33.0 , respectively ; P = 0.002 ) , as were the percent changes in non-HDL-C ( -37.4 vs -31.1 ; P = 0.004 ) , Apo B ( -35.1 vs -28.2 ; P < 0.001 ) , and Apo E ( -28.1 vs -17.8 ; P < 0.001 ). The significant results for these parameters were unchanged when all 189 subjects who received > or = 1 dose of study medication were included in the analysis , using last-value-carried-forward methodology. There were no significant differences between treatments with respect to the measures of glucose metabolism. Both statins appeared to be well tolerated. Adverse events occurred in 9 % ( 9/96 ) of the pitavastatin group and 14 % ( 13/93 ) of the atorvastatin group ( P = NS ). Two patients in the pitavastatin group and none in the atorvastatin group had an alanine aminotransferase value > 3 times the upper limit of normal ( P = NS ). In these patients with elevated LDL-C levels and glucose intolerance , 52 weeks of treatment with pitavastatin 2 mg/d was associated with significantly greater increases in HDL-C and Apo A-I levels than atorvastatin 10 mg/d.

Several reviews and meta-analyses report that PA independently produces clinically important improvements in glucose control in people with Type 2 diabetes. However , it remains unclear what the optimal strategies are to increase PA behaviour in people with Type 2 diabetes in routine primary care. Movement as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes ( MaMT2D ) was registered with Current Controlled Trials on the 14th January 2012 : ISRCTN67997502. The first primary care practice was randomised on the 5th October 2012. This study will determine whether an evidence-informed multifaceted behaviour change intervention ( Movement as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes ) targeting both consultation behaviour of primary healthcare professionals and PA behaviour in adults with Type 2 diabetes is both acceptable and feasible in the primary care setting. An open pilot study conducted in two primary care practices ( phase one ) will assess acceptability , feasibility and fidelity. Ongoing feedback from participating primary healthcare professionals and patients will provide opportunities for systematic adaptation and refinement of the intervention and study procedures. A two-arm parallel group clustered pilot randomised controlled trial with patients from participating primary care practices in North East England will assess acceptability , feasibility , and fidelity of the intervention ( versus usual clinical care ) and trial processes over a 12-month period. Consultation behaviour involving fidelity of intervention delivery , diabetes and PA related knowledge , attitudes/beliefs , intentions and self-efficacy for delivering a behaviour change intervention targeting PA behaviour will be assessed in primary healthcare professionals. We will rehearse the collection of outcome data ( with the focus on data yield and quality ) for a future definitive trial , through outcome assessment at baseline , one , six and twelve months. An embedded qualitative process evaluation and treatment fidelity assessment will explore issues around intervention implementation and assess whether intervention components can be reliably and faithfully delivered in routine primary care. Movement as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes will address an important gap in the evidence-base , that is , the need for interventions to increase free-living PA behaviour in adults with Type 2 diabetes. The multifaceted intervention incorporates an online accredited training programme for primary healthcare professionals and represents , to the best of our knowledge , the first of its kind in the United Kingdom.

We investigated the influence of the prevailing protein intake on the regional utilization and anabolic use of wheat protein during the postprandial non-steady state in humans. Healthy adults ( n = 8 ) were adapted for 7 d , first to a normal-protein diet ( NP : 1 g x kg ( -1 ) x d ( -1 ) ) and then to a high-protein diet ( HP : 2 g x kg ( -1 ) x d ( -1 ) ). After each adaptation period , the subjects received the same single , solid mixed meal containing [ 15N ] - labeled wheat protein. The postprandial kinetics of dietary nitrogen were then measured for 8 h in blood and urine. These data were further analyzed by using a multicompartmental model to predict the postprandial kinetics of dietary nitrogen in unsampled pools. The postprandial whole-body retention of wheat protein nitrogen , measured 8 h after meal ingestion , decreased by 10 % when the subjects switched from the NP diet to the HP diet. According to modeling results , this resulted from an increased splanchnic utilization of dietary nitrogen for urea production , whereas its incorporation into splanchnic proteins was unchanged , leading to a 20-30 % decrease in peripheral availability and anabolic use in HP-adapted compared with NP-adapted subjects having ingested the same protein load. By combining clinical experimentation with compartmental modeling , we provide a global overview of postprandial dietary protein metabolism. Increasing prior protein intake was shown to reduce the postprandial retention of wheat protein nitrogen , mainly by diminishing the efficiency of its peripheral availability and anabolic use. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Thirty-two infants ( 40 2.3 weeks gestational age ; 10.6 days at time of surgery ) undergoing open-heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized to receive an intravenous lipid emulsion with ( treatment ) or without ( control ) eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid in this prospective , randomized , double-blind , controlled trial. Mean plasma TNF - concentration was significantly ( p = 0.003 ) lower in the treatment ( 5.9 pg/mL ) compared to the control group ( 14.8 pg/mL ). In infants without sepsis , plasma TNF - did not differ according to treatment , however when sepsis developed , mean plasma TNF - was 21.1 pg/mL and 1.5 pg/mL ( p = 0.0007 ) in control and treatment groups , respectively. Plasma TNF - was positively correlated with length of hospital stay in the control group ( p = 0.01 ) , and negatively correlated with length of stay in the treatment group ( p = 0.004 ) , with a significant time by treatment interaction ( p = 0.02 ). Providing a lipid emulsion containing eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid reduces TNF - concentrations in infants undergoing open-heart surgery. Lipid emulsions containing eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid may ameliorate the inflammatory response among critically ill infants. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Whether a more conservative surgical approach at greater risk of recurrence , or a more radical intervention with an increased risk of facial paralysis is warranted is still under discussion. Our study addresses the opportunity for improving surgical outcome by employing platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) gel at the surgical site. Twenty consecutive patients undergoing superficial parotidectomy were randomized and assigned to two groups , one with and one without PRP gel. Many parameters were evaluated after surgery and during follow-up , such as the duration of hospitalization , facial nerve deficit , onset of Frey 's syndrome , relapse , cosmetic results , presence of keloid or scar depressions , behavior of several facial muscles. Our explorative analysis suggests a positive effect of PRP on surgical outcome in patients undergoing parotidectomy , whereas no negative effects were detected.

The present substudy of a prospective , randomized , multicenter trial conducted in 69 of 488 consecutive Crohn 's disease ( CD ) patients was designed to investigate the way in which healthcare utilization is influenced by psychotherapy and relaxation in addition to standardized glucocorticoid therapy. Before and after a 1-year period of standardized somatic treatment the psychotherapy and control groups were compared with regard to hospital and sick-leave days. Predictors of healthcare utilization were analyzed. The comparison between groups before and after psychological treatment showed a significantly higher decrease of mean hospital days ( P < 0.03 ) and sick-leave days in the treatment group compared with the controls. When a covariate analysis was applied to compare the data at randomization , the difference in hospital days remained statistically a trend ( P < 0.1 ). Multivariate regression analysis detected a significant gender and depression effect for hospital days ( cor r ( 2 ) = 0.114 ) and a significant gender and age effect for sick-leave days ( cor r ( 2 ) = 0.112 ). A significant drop in healthcare utilization after psychological treatment demonstrates a clear benefit of this additional therapy.

One hundred and forty-two LSMC patients were randomized into four groups : the two single treated groups treated by endocrinotherapy ( ET ) alone ( n = 27 ) and by chemotherapy alone ( n = 44 ) respectively , and the two PXC combined treated groups treated with PXC plus endocrinotherapy ( n = 27 ) or chemotherapy ( n = 44 ). The remission rate and progression time ( TTP ) of disease , the survival time and quality of life ( QOL ) of patients , and the adverse reaction were compared between the single treated groups and the combined treated groups. The median progression time was obviously prolonged , and QOL improved in the combined treated groups than those in the single treated groups ( P < 0.05 ) , but no significant difference was found in the remission rate or adverse reaction between them. PXC can improve QOL , prolong the progression time in patients of LSMC , and with less adverse reaction.

This study aimed to determine the effects of an exercise training intervention on insulin sensitivity in both groups. Women offspring ( n = 34 ) of type 2 diabetic patients ( offspring age 35.6 + / - 7.0 years , BMI 28.1 + / - 5.1 kg/m ( 2 ) ) and 36 matched female controls ( age 33.6 + / - 6.1 years , BMI 27.3 + / - 4.7 kg/m ( 2 ) ) participated. Body composition , fitness and metabolic measurements were made at baseline and after a controlled 7 week exercise intervention. At baseline , insulin sensitivity index ( ISI ) was 22 % lower in offspring than controls ( p < 0.05 ) , despite similar body fat and maximal oxygen uptake (. VO ( 2max ) ) values in the two groups. ISI increased by 23 % ( p < 0.05 ) in offspring following the exercise intervention , compared with 7 % ( NS ) in the controls. Increases in. VO ( 2max ) were similar in both groups ( controls 12 % , offspring 15 % , p < 0.05 for both ). Plasma leptin concentrations decreased significantly in the offspring ( -24 % , p < 0.01 ) but not in controls ( 0 % , NS ). Change in ISI correlated significantly with baseline ISI ( r = -0.47 , p < 0.0005 ) and change in leptin ( r = -0.43 , p < 0.0005 ). The latter relationship was not attenuated by adjustment for changes in body fat. Offspring , but not controls , significantly increased ISI in response to an exercise intervention , indicating that insulin sensitivity is more highly modulated by physical activity in daughters of patients with type 2 diabetes than in women with no family history of the disease. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

She discovers that the enzyme is present in most body tissues and is located in the cytoplasm of the cells expressing the enzyme. She decides to mix this enzyme under subphysiologic conditions with varying levels of glucose in order to determine the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Specifically, she adds increasing levels of glucose at a saturating concentration of phosphate and sees that the rate at which glucose becomes phosphorylated gets faster at higher levels of glucose. She observes that this rate approaches a maximum speed and calls this speed Y. She then determines the concentration of glucose that is needed to make the enzyme function at half the speed Y and calls this concentration X. Which of the following is most likely true about the properties of this enzyme?\n (A) High X and high Y\n (B) High X and low Y\n (C) Low X and high Y\n (D) Low X and infinite Y\n (E) Low X and low Y</QUESTION>\n<ANSWER>  (C) Low X and high Y</ANSWER>\nPlease select one of the options from the table above.

Twenty-three patients were included in the study. All of them underwent a course of postoperative tangential breast irradiation. The patients were prospectively randomised into two groups. Group A patients ( n = 11 ) received a conventional computed tomography - based treatment planning , group B patients ( n = 12 ) a virtual simulation. The results of both treatment planning procedures were compared. The treatment planning was feasible in all patients. The time expenditure could be reduced from a median of 45.0 to 16.5 min and from 55.0 to 32.0 min for the technician and physician , respectively , using virtual simulation. Furthermore the treatment planning for the patient could be reduced from a median of 45.0 min in two sessions to 16.5 min in one session. The image quality of the digital reconstructed radiographs was satisfying compared to the simulation films. The incidence and extension of set-up corrections for the patients at the first treatment were comparable in both groups. The time interval between the planning CT and the first treatment could be reduced by 31 % using virtual simulation due to the omission of the conventional simulation. The virtual simulation is a feasible tool for the treatment planning of patients undergoing tangential irradiation of the breast. Compared with the conventional simulation procedure virtual simulation is superior regarding to the precision of patients marking , the quality of the reference images and , the time expenditure for the patients and medical staff. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

This pilot study was conducted to find the optimum dose of glimepiride in NANSY. In a double blind trial in primary care 25 IFG subjects were in random order exposed to single doses and one-week treatments with 0 ( placebo ) , 0.5 , 1.0 and 2.0 mg glimepiride once daily. The optimum dose was assessed by measuring blood glucose during oral 75 g glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , comparing fasting blood glucose , and the area under the blood glucose curve ( AUC ) , and by monitoring hypoglycaemic events. With single doses , there was a clear dose-response relationship for the reduction in AUC , with a statistically significant difference only between placebo ( mean 1981 , 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) 1883-2078 ) and 2 mg glimepiride ( mean 1763 , 95 % CI 1665-1861 ). However , following 1-week treatments , the only significant difference was between placebo ( mean 1934 , 95 % CI 1856-2012 ) and 1 mg glimepiride ( mean 1714 , 95 % CI 1637-1792 ). Correspondingly , the only statistically significant difference in fasting blood glucose day 7 was between placebo ( 5.87 mmol/l , 95 % CI 5.68-6 .05 mmol/l ) and 1 mg glimepiride ( 5.42 mmol/l , 95 % CI 5.21-5 .62 mmol/l ). Chemical hypoglycaemia was common but hypoglycaemic symptoms were rare and similar between the active doses , and easily countered by the subjects. The sulphonylurea dose-effect curve may be bell-shaped , perhaps due to down regulation of sulphonylurea receptors during chronic exposure. Alternatively , the finding could be a rebound phenomenon , secondary to preceding hypoglycaemia. The optimum dose for NANSY was found to be 1 mg glimepiride. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

We sought to evaluate efficacy and safety of etanercept plus topical clobetasol propionate ( CP ) foam versus etanercept monotherapy for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Adults with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ( PASI ) score greater than or equal to 10 and psoriasis-affected body surface area greater than or equal to 10 % were randomized to etanercept with CP as needed to clear ( 2 up-to-2-week courses , weeks 11-12 and 23-24 ) or etanercept alone ( each arm at 50 mg twice weekly for 12 weeks followed by 50 mg once weekly for 12 weeks ). A total of 592 patients enrolled ( 295 etanercept + CP arm ; 297 etanercept arm ). At week 12 , significant differences were observed for response of 75 % improvement in PASI score ( primary end point , 65.2 % vs 48.3 % in the etanercept + CP vs etanercept arms , respectively ; P < .001 ) , response of 90 % improvement in PASI score ( 29.7 % vs 19.4 % ; P = .009 ) , percentage PASI score improvement ( 76.5 % vs 68.2 % ; P < .001 ) , static physician global assessment of clear/almost clear ( 63.1 % vs 47.3 % ; P < .001 ) , and patient satisfaction with treatment ( P = .006 ). Response of 75 % improvement in PASI score and static physician global assessment of clear/almost clear were not significantly different between arms at week 24. Patient satisfaction with treatment ( P = .001 ) and percentage improvement in PASI score ( P = .031 ) were also greater in the etanercept + CP arm compared with etanercept only at week 24. Comparable numbers of adverse events occurred in each arm. No placebo for CP foam was provided in the etanercept arm. Addition of CP to etanercept yielded increased efficacy compared with etanercept alone at week 12 without an increase in treatment-related adverse events. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Therapy with aminosalicylates , antimetabolites , or antibiotics leads to a modest reduction in the incidence of recurrence. We sought to examine whether metronidazole for 3 months together with azathioprine ( AZA ) for 12 months is superior to metronidazole alone to reduce recurrence of postoperative CD in `` high-risk '' patients. CD patients undergoing curative ileocecal resection with > or = 1 risk factor for recurrence received metronidazole ( 3 months ) and AZA/placebo ( 12 months ). The primary end point was the proportion of patients with significant endoscopic recurrence 3 and 12 months after surgery. Secondary end points included clinical recurrence , safety , and tolerability of treatment. Eighty-one patients were randomized ; 19 discontinued the study early. Significant endoscopic recurrence was observed in 14 of 32 ( 43.7 % ) patients in the AZA group and in 20 of 29 ( 69.0 % ) patients in the placebo group at 12 months postsurgery ( P = .048 ). Intention-to-treat analysis revealed endoscopic recurrence in 22 of 40 ( 55 % ) in the AZA group and 32 of 41 ( 78 % ) in the placebo group at month 12 ( P = .035 ). At month 12 , 7 of 32 patients had no endoscopic lesions in the AZA group , versus 1 of 29 in the placebo group ( P = .037 ). Despite the enhanced risk of recurrence , the overall incidence of significant recurrence was rather low , probably owing to the metronidazole treatment that all patients received. Concomitant AZA resulted in lower endoscopic recurrence rates and less severe recurrences 12 months postsurgery , predicting a more favorable clinical outcome. This combined treatment seems to be recommendable to all operated CD patients with an enhanced risk for recurrence. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Here we report a 20-year follow-up of this investigation. In 1973 we began a trial involving 386 women who were randomly assigned to receive either no further treatment after radical mastectomy ( 179 women ) or 12 monthly cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy ( 207 women ). All patients were admitted to the Istituto Nazionale Tumori in Milan , Italy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was delivered in the outpatient clinic of the Division of Medical Oncology. After a median follow-up of 19.4 years , the patients given adjuvant combination chemotherapy had significantly better rates of relapse-free survival ( unadjusted relative risk of relapse , 0.71 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.56 to 0.90 ; P = 0.004 ; adjusted relative risk , 0.65 , 95 percent confidence interval , 0.51 to 0.83 ; P < 0.001 ) and total survival ( unadjusted relative risk of death , 0.78 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.62 to 0.99 ; P = 0.04 ; adjusted relative risk , 0.76 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.60 to 0.97 ; P = 0.03 ). With the exception of postmenopausal women , a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy was evident in all subgroups of patients.

We have now investigated the relation between several baseline hemostatic and conventional risk factors and CC-IMT changes over 16 months in 64 patients with peripheral arterial disease randomly selected from the prospective PLAT study series. Samples from 24 patients ( 37.5 % ) who showed increases in CC-IMT during the follow-up period were compared with those from 40 ( 62.5 % ) in whom CC-IMT remained unchanged. Baseline conventional risk factors and coagulation variables were similar in the two groups except for higher plasma concentrations of von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) ( 178.3 + / - 53.6 % versus 141.2 + / - 53.7 % , P = .01 ) and factor VII ( FVII ) ( 133.9 + / - 36.4 % versus 107.0 + / - 27.3 % , P = .001 ) in the patients with increased CC-IMT. CC-IMT increase correlated positively with plasma levels of FVII ( r = .31 , P < .01 ) and vWF ( r = .31 , P < .01 ). Multiple stepwise regression analysis identified FVII as the only independent variable associated with an increase in CC-IMT ( beta = .83 , P = .01 ). High plasma concentration of FVII and vWF may be associated with the progression of early carotid atherosclerosis in patients with peripheral arterial disease. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Adiponectin is lower in obese children but its relationship with vascular function has not been clarified in childhood. We aimed to evaluate the association between adiponectin and vascular function in obese and healthy children. Forty-nine obese and thirty-three non-obese children ( aged 13.4 + / -2.8 years , 37 males ) participated in a cross-sectional study. We measured adiponectin , vascular endothelial and smooth muscle function ( Flow mediated dilatation [ FMD ] and glyceryl trinitrate induced dilatation [ GTN ] ) , serum folate , red cell folate ( RCF ) , homocysteine , lipids , glucose and insulin. Because adiponectin related to RCF we examined the effect of folate supplementation on adiponectin levels in obese children in a previously conducted randomized folate intervention trial. This included two assessments prior to intervention and two post intervention. Adiponectin , FMD and GTN were lower in obese compared with non-obese children ( p = 0.002 , p = 0.03 and p < 0.001 , respectively ). In obesity , adiponectin related to GTN ( beta = 0.46 , p < 0.001 ) , RCF ( beta = 0.4 , p = 0.001 ) and LDL cholesterol ( beta = 0.33 , p = 0.004 ). Adiponectin associations were affected by gender and adiponectin related to female gender ( B = 0.22 , p = 0.03 ). During the intervention trial , folic acid did not improve adiponectin levels ( p = 0.8 ) in spite of increasing serum folate and RCF ( p < 0.001 , p < 0.001 , respectively ) and decreasing homocysteine levels ( p = 0.008 ). Obese children have lower adiponectin , which relates to decreased smooth muscle function and lower folate status.

Sixty patients of ASA class I-II scheduled to receive laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly assigned to two groups equally , Group A , the control group , and Group B , the compound anesthesia group. The general anesthesia applied on them during operation was induced by combined midazolam , fentanyl , propofol and vecuronium bromide , but for those in Group B , 15 min of electric stimulation at bilateral Neiguan ( PC6 ) , Hegu ( LI4 ) and Quchi ( LI11 ) was given with an acupuncture anesthesia apparatus before the drug induction as acupuncture anesthesia induction , then the general anesthesia started and maintained the same as that in Group A. Changes of cardiac function and hemodynamics were monitored using thoracic electrical bio-impedance method at different time points of operation , i.e. the baseline before induction ( T0 ) , after induction when loss of consciousness ( T1 ) , during intubation ( T2 ) , beginning of operation ( T3 ) , ending of operation ( T4 ) , during extubation ( T5 ) and 10 min after extubation ( T6 ). No significant difference between the two groups was found in operation lasting time and anesthesia maintaining time ( P > 0.05 ). The amount of vecuronium bromide consumed in an unit of time in Group B was significantly lower than that in Group A ( P < 0.05 ). The mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , heart rate ( HR ) , rate pressure product ( RPP ) , cardiac output ( CO ) , systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) , and blood flow acceleration index ( ACI ) in Group A at T1 were all significantly lower ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) , but became significantly higher at T2 and T5 as compared with those of baseline ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) , while no significant change of them was found in Group B. Moreover , MAP , RPP , SVR and ACI were significantly higher in Group A than those in Group B at T2 and T5 ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ).

In this analysis of a subgroup of participants involved in a randomized controlled trial , consistent condom use , psychosocial mediators associated with HIV-preventive behaviors , and presence of sexually transmitted diseases were assessed at 6 - and 12-month follow-ups. The intervention emphasized ethnic and gender pride , HIV knowledge , condom attitudes , healthy relationships , communication , and condom use skills. Relative to the comparison condition , participants randomized to the intervention reported using condoms more consistently , had fewer episodes of unprotected vaginal sex , engaged in a greater proportion of protected intercourse acts , were more likely to have used a condom during their most recent intercourse , were less likely to have a new sexual partner , were less likely to have a sexually transmitted disease , and demonstrated more proficient condom skills. Given the substantial prevalence of gender-based violence among female adolescents and the associations observed between gender-based violence , HIV risk , and HIV infection , it is essential that HIV interventions involving young women address partner violence. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different lipid-lowering strategies on BP control of subjects with hypercholesterolemia who were enrolled in the prospective , population-based , longitudinal Brisighella Heart Study. A total of 1356 subjects with total cholesterol levels > or = 239 mg/dL were randomly treated for 5 years ( 1988-1993 ) with 1 of these lipid-lowering regimens : low-fat diet , cholestyramine , gemfibrozil , or simvastatin. Participants were divided at baseline into 4 quartiles according to systolic BP level and examined for the percent change in systolic and diastolic BP during the 5 years of treatment. A significant decrease in BP was observed in the 2 upper quartiles of systolic BP ( > or = 140 mm Hg ) and was greater in subjects treated with cholesterol-lowering drugs who also had a greater reduction in plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The BP decrease was greater in patients treated with statin drugs and , among those treated with antihypertensive drugs , in subjects in the fourth quartile. The use of lipid-lowering measures could significantly improve BP control in subjects with both hypercholesterolemia and hypertension.

We aimed to find out whether shortening of treatment time by use of six instead of five radiotherapy fractions per week improves the tumour response in squamous-cell carcinoma. We did a multicentre , controlled , randomised trial. Between January , 1992 , and December , 1999 , of 1485 patients treated with primary radiotherapy alone , 1476 eligible patients were randomly assigned five ( n = 726 ) or six ( n = 750 ) fractions per week at the same total dose and fraction number ( 66-68 Gy in 33-34 fractions to all tumour sites except well-differentiated T1 glottic tumours , which were treated with 62 Gy ). All patients , except those with glottic cancers , also received the hypoxic radiosensitiser nimorazole. Analysis was by intention to treat. More than 97 % of the patients received the planned total dose. Median overall treatment times were 39 days ( six-fraction group ) and 46 days ( five-fraction group ). Overall 5-year locoregional control rates were 70 % and 60 % for the six-fraction and five-fraction groups , respectively ( p = 0.0005 ). The whole benefit of shortening of treatment time was seen for primary tumour control ( 76 vs 64 % for six and five fractions , p = 0.0001 ) , but was non-significant for neck-node control. Six compared with five fractions per week improved preservation of the voice among patients with laryngeal cancer ( 80 vs 68 % , p = 0.007 ). Disease-specific survival improved ( 73 vs 66 % for six and five fractions , p = 0.01 ) but not overall survival. Acute morbidity was significantly more frequent with six than with five fractions , but was transient. The shortening of overall treatment time by increase of the weekly number of fractions is beneficial in patients with head and neck cancer.

Study 1 was a 12-week , multicentre , randomized , double blind and placebo-controlled study of nateglinide monotherapy ( 120 mg , before meals ) in 66 drug-nave patients with T2DM aged > or = 65 years. Study 2 was a 104-week , multicentre , randomized , double blind and active-controlled study of nateglinide ( 120 mg , before meals ) or glyburide ( up to 5 mg bid ) in combination with metformin ( up to 1000 mg bid ) in 69 treatment-nave patients with T2DM aged > or = 65 years. HbA ( 1c ) , fasting and postprandial glucose levels , and safety assessments were made. In Study 1 , nateglinide significantly reduced HbA ( 1c ) from baseline ( 7.6 + / - 0.1 % to 6.9 + / - 0.1 % ; Delta = -0.7 + / - 0.1 % , p < 0.001 ) and compared with placebo ( between-group difference = -0.5 % , p = 0.004 vs. nateglinide ). No hypoglycaemia was reported. In Study 2 , combination therapy with nateglinide/metformin significantly reduced HbA ( 1c ) from baseline ( 7.8 + / - 0.2 % to 6.6 + / - 0.1 % ; Delta = -1.2 + / - 0.2 % , p < 0.001 ) , as did glyburide/metformin ( 7.7 + / - 0.1 % to 6.5 + / - 0.1 % ; Delta = -1.2 + / - 0.1 % , p < 0.001 ). There was no difference between treatments ( p = 0.310 ). One nateglinide/metformin-treated patient experienced a mild hypoglycaemic episode compared with eight episodes in eight patients on glyburide/metformin ; one severe episode led to discontinuation. Target HbA ( 1c ) ( < 7.0 % ) was achieved by 60 % of patients receiving nateglinide ( Study 1 ) and 70 % of nateglinide/metformin-treated patients ( Study 2 ).

Extensive theoretical and research literature suggests that peer support and regular exercise are critically important and can efficiently manage stress for nursing students. : The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a school-based health promotion program in a group physical activity intervention and peer support program for stressed nursing students. : This study used a quasi-experimental design to collect information and collected data from a stress questionnaire , semistructured questionnaire , and group discussion. Participants included 77 nursing students at an institute of technology in northern Taiwan. Participants were randomly assigned into experimental ( n = 37 ) and control ( n = 40 ) groups. Program duration was 16 weeks. Participants were selected based on their assessment results as having moderate or severe levels of stress. All participants in the experimental group took part in a group physical activity for 30 minutes three times a week. Eight weeks later , the researcher invited each group to discuss their feelings and stress coping strategies. Both groups completed pretest and posttest stress questionnaires. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS 14.0 Statistical Package for Windows , and qualitative data from each group discussion were analyzed using content analysis. : Results revealed that level of stress was statistically decreased in the experimental group. Posttest stress levels were significantly different in experimental and control groups. The results suggested that students who participated in the intervention had less stress than did those in the control group after the intervention. Those in the experimental group held positive views of peer support and physical activity. : The results of this study confirmed the efficacy of school-based health promotion programs in reducing stress in nursing students. Findings may provide educators with information to assist their developing effective health promotion programs to manage stress for their students.

Twenty surgical sites were assigned to two treatment groups , inlay and onlay , with iliac crest as donor site. After 3 to 4 months , 43 implants were placed and loaded 4 months later. The median follow up after loading was 18 months. For the inlay versus onlay group , median bone gain was 4.9 versus 6.5 mm ( p = .019 ) , median bone resorption was 0.5 versus 2.75 mm ( p < .001 ) , and median final vertical augmentation was 4.1 versus 4 mm ( p = .190 ). The implant survival rate was 100 % in both groups , while the implant success rate was 90 % versus 86.9 % ( p = .190 , not significant ). A minor and major complication rate of 20 % and 10 % , respectively , for both groups was encountered. Inlay results in less bone resorption and more predictable outcomes , but requires an experienced surgeon.

To investigate whether this effect also occurs with pumaprazole ( BY841 ) , a reversible proton pump antagonist which , in contrast to omeprazole , does not require activation in the acid compartment of the parietal cell. In a randomized , crossover , double-blind study , 24-h intragastric pH was measured in 13 H. pylori-positive subjects before and after a 1-week course of omeprazole ( 20 mg o.d. ) or of pumaprazole ( 100 mg b.d. ). The studies were repeated after the infection was cured. In the absence of drug administration , the median 24-h pH values before cure ( median 2.0 , 90 % CI : 1.2-3 .2 ) did not differ from those after cure ( median 1.5 , 90 % CI : 1.3-2 .2 ; P = 0.115 ). The 24-h pH values were higher before cure of the infection than after during both pumaprazole ( 6.0 , 4.8-6 .7 vs. 4.3 , 2.6-5 .7 ; P = 0.002 ) and omeprazole ( 5.8 , 4.0-6 .2 vs. 3.6 , 2.8-5 ; P = 0.004 ). Both before and after cure , there were no significant differences between the two drugs with respect to acid inhibition over the 24-h period. The median decrease in acid inhibition after cure of the infection ( calculated as the difference in H + activity in mmol/L ) during pumaprazole ( median 0.05 , 90 % CI : 6 x 10-4 - 2.3 ) was no different from that during omeprazole ( median 0.2 , 90 % CI : 3 x 10-3-1 .5 ; P = 0.6 ). Both before and after cure of H. pylori infection , pumaprazole raised the intragastric pH over a 24-h period to a similar degree as omeprazole. H. pylori infection similarly augments the pH-increasing effect of both drugs. This effect is related to H. pylori infection and not to an increased activation of acid inhibitory agents in the parietal cell compartment. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Prospective randomized clinical study. Single tertiary academic medical center. Infants ( 0-1 year ) who underwent congenital heart surgery requiring hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass ( n = 18 ). Patients with open wounds and/or patients treated with an investigational drug or device within 30 days of surgery were excluded. Randomized use of thermoregulation system ( warming garment , n = 9 ) or routine thermal care ( control , n = 9 ) after separating from cardiopulmonary bypass until the arrival to the pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ). There were no statistically significant differences in the demographic data , cardiopulmonary bypass time , operating room time , incidence of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest , and cooling temperature between the groups. The nasopharyngeal temperature was significantly higher in the warming garment group after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. Nasopharyngeal temperature at 20 minutes was 36.5 degrees C versus 35.01 degrees C ( p = 0.0047 ) , at 40 minutes was 36.98 degrees C versus 35.30 degrees C ( p = 0.034 ) , and at admission to the PICU was 36.09 degrees C versus 35.31 degrees C ( p = not significant ). There was no difference in the core-to-peripheral temperature gradient ( nasopharyngeal-to-skin temperature ) between the 2 study groups at any time point. No adverse events related to the use of the warming garment thermoregulation system were observed. The investigated thermoregulation system was effective in preventing the after-drop of temperature that occurs after cardiopulmonary bypass in small infants compared with routine warming methods. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Three preference assessments ( a value score for the EuroQol instrument and value and utility scores for the Health Utilities Index ) made three months after randomization. The averages for each of the three scores , stratified by clinical outcomes and attributes of the Health Utilities Index health status classification system , were compared. To evaluate potential sources of difference between the instruments , the authors estimated two alternative Health Utilities Index scoring rules that were based on patient responses to the EuroQol instrument. Patients ' ratings of their current health made by using the 100-point visual analog scale from the EuroQol instrument were more similar to the utility scores for the Health Utilities Index than they were to the value scores for the Health Utilities Index. The biggest differences between the visual analog scores for the EuroQol instrument and the utility scores for the Health Utilities index were seen at higher levels of functioning. For states representing higher levels of functioning , differences were seen between patients ' self-ratings obtained by using the EuroQol instrument and the patients ' utility scores on the Health Utilities Index ; for states representing lower levels of functioning , substantial agreement was observed between these two scores. Differences observed at the higher levels of functioning suggest that further research is needed to determine whether the Health Utility Index 's assignment of a score of 1.0 to the reference state representing being healthy is appropriate. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

The value of eradicating the infection in patients with dyspepsia and no evidence of ulcer disease is not known. We performed a randomized , placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy of treatment for two weeks with 20 mg of omeprazole orally twice daily , 500 mg of amoxicillin three times daily ( with 500 mg of tetracycline three times daily substituted for amoxicillin in patients allergic to penicillin ) , and 400 mg of metronidazole three times daily ( 160 patients ) with that of omeprazole alone ( 158 patients ) for resolving symptoms of dyspepsia in patients with H. pylori infection but no evidence of ulcer disease on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Symptoms were assessed with the Glasgow Dyspepsia Severity Score , with resolution of symptoms defined as a score of 0 or 1 in the preceding six months ( maximal score , 20 ). One year later the patients were assessed to determine the frequency of the resolution of symptoms. One month after the completion of treatment , 132 of 150 patients ( 88 percent ) in the group assigned to received omeprazole and antibiotics had a negative test for H. pylori , as compared with 7 of 152 ( 5 percent ) in the group assigned to receive omeprazole alone. One year later , dyspepsia had resolved in 33 of 154 patients ( 21 percent ) in the group given omeprazole and antibiotics , as compared with 11 of 154 ( 7 percent ) in the group given omeprazole alone ( 95 percent confidence interval for the difference , 7 to 22 percent ; P < 0.001 ). Among the patients in the group given omeprazole and antibiotics , the symptoms resolved in 26 of the 98 patients ( 27 percent ) who had had symptoms for five years or less , as compared with 7 of the 56 patients ( 12 percent ) who had had symptoms for more than five years ( P = 0.03 ). In patients with H. pylori infection and nonulcer , or functional , dyspepsia , treatment with omeprazole and antibiotics to eradicate the infection is more likely to resolve symptoms than treatment with omeprazole alone. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

A total of 109 patients ( 55 female and 54 male ; mean age : 51 14 years ) with primary or secondary dentinal caries were randomly assigned to the two treatment groups of this biomedical clinical trial ( phase III ). Selection criteria were good systemic health and treated teeth , which were vital and showed no symptoms of pulpitis. Up to three teeth were prepared for indirect metallic restorations , and the provisional restorations were cemented with a triamcinolone/demeclocycyline ( Ledermix ) or a calcium hydroxide ( Provicol ) based material. The intensity of post-operative pain experienced was documented according to the VAS ( 4 , 12 , 20 , 24 , and 82 h ) and compared to VAS baseline. A total of 159 teeth were treated ( Ledermix : 83 teeth , Provicol : 76 teeth ). The minor irritation of the teeth , experienced prior to treatment , was similar in both groups ; however , 4 h after treatment this value was significantly higher in the Provicol group than in the Ledermix group ( p < 0.005 , t-test ). After 12 h , the difference was no longer significant. The number of patients taking analgesics for post-treatment pain was higher in the Provicol group ( n = 11/53 ) than in the Ledermix group ( n = 3/56 ). The patients had no long term post-operative pain experience in both groups.

The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism ( s ) of this decrease in plasma TG levels in atorvastatin-treated subjects. Lipoprotein separation and plasma analysis of lipids , glucose and insulin were performed in subjects randomly assigned to placebo ( n = 9 ) or atorvastatin ( 80 mg per day ) ( n = 10 ) for 4 weeks. Liver TG mass was determined in pooled samples. Hepatic expression of several genes involved in carbohydrate and TG metabolism was determined. Atorvastatin lowered plasma levels of very low-density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) TG ( 50 % , P < 0.05 ) and liver TG mass compared to placebo. Except for cholesterol changes , there were no other significant differences in plasma lipids , glucose or insulin. However , atorvastatin reduced mRNA expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c ( SREBP1c ) ( > 30 % , P < 0.05 ) , glucokinase ( 50 % , P < 0.05 ) and angiopoietin-like protein 3 ( ANGPTL3 ) ( 25 % , P < 0.01 ) , and induced mRNA expression of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase 1 ( 45 % , P < 0.05 ) and glucose-6-phosphatase ( 90 % , P < 0.05 ) compared to placebo. Following treatment with atorvastatin , reduced ANGPTL3 mRNA expression may contribute to the reduced plasma levels of VLDL TG. The reduced liver TG mass induced by a high dosage of atorvastatin may be important for the treatment of patients with fatty liver. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

An exploratory trial in which overweight and obese adults were randomized either to a habit-based intervention condition ( with two subgroups given weekly vs monthly weighing ; n = 33 , n = 36 ) or to a waiting-list control condition ( n = 35 ) over 8 weeks. Intervention participants were followed up for 8 months. A total of 104 adults ( 35 men , 69 women ) with an average BMI of 30.9 kg m ( -2 ). Intervention participants were given a leaflet containing advice on habit formation and simple recommendations for eating and activity behaviours promoting negative energy balance , together with a self-monitoring checklist. Weight change over 8 weeks in the intervention condition compared with the control condition and weight loss maintenance over 32 weeks in the intervention condition. At 8 weeks , people in the intervention condition had lost significantly more weight ( mean = 2.0 kg ) than those in the control condition ( 0.4 kg ) , with no difference between weekly and monthly weighing subgroups. At 32 weeks , those who remained in the study had lost an average of 3.8 kg , with 54 % losing 5 % or more of their body weight. An intention-to-treat analysis ( based on last-observation-carried-forward ) reduced this to 2.6 kg , with 26 % achieving a 5 % weight loss.

Interventions were tested at 28 worksites with 5,042 employees. This report describes results of the screening promotion intervention. Worksites randomized to the control group received a standard program including rectal examination , fecal occult blood testing , and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Intervention worksites received an enhanced program ( i.e. , standard program plus an educational booklet/telephone call ). Compliance ( i.e. , completion of all recommended screening examinations ) and coverage ( i.e. , completion of at least one screening examination ) , the primary and secondary outcomes , were measured over 2 years. In the 2 years prior to baseline , 61 % of employees had been screened. After random assignment , baseline differences in several employee characteristics and worksite screening procedures were detected , including more past history of screening in control worksites. After adjusting for differences , we found modest , but higher , compliance and coverage in intervention compared with control worksites ( odds ratio [ 95 % confidence limits ] = 1.46 [ 1.1-2 .0 ] and 1.33 [ 1.1 , 1.6 ] , respectively ).

However , long-term administration of low-dose aspirin is associated with a greater risk of adverse events , including gastroduodenal ulcers. This study determined the efficacy of esomeprazole for reducing the risk of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and dyspeptic symptoms in patients receiving continuous , low-dose aspirin therapy. Patients aged > or = 60 yr , without baseline gastroduodenal ulcer at endoscopy , who were receiving aspirin 75-325 mg once daily , were randomized to esomeprazole 20 mg once daily or placebo for 26 wk. The presence of endoscopic gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and esophageal lesions was assessed at weeks 8 and 26. Upper gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed at weeks 8 , 16 , and 26. The intention-to-treat population comprised 991 patients ( esomeprazole , N = 493 ; placebo , N = 498 ). Twenty-seven patients ( 5.4 % ) in the placebo group developed a gastric or duodenal ulcer during 26 weeks ' treatment compared with eight patients ( 1.6 % ) in the esomeprazole group ( life-table estimates : 6.2 % vs 1.8 % ; P = 0.0007 ). At 26 wk , the cumulative proportion of patients with erosive esophagitis was significantly lower for esomeprazole versus placebo ( 4.4 % and 18.3 % , respectively ; P < 0.0001 ). At 26 wk , esomeprazole-treated patients were more likely to experience resolution of heartburn , acid regurgitation , and epigastric pain ( P < 0.05 ).

The incidence of angiographic restenosis was 44.6 % ( 41/92 ) in the balloon angioplasty group , 14.3 % ( 13/91 ) in the sirolimus stent group ( P < .001 vs balloon angioplasty ) , and 21.7 % ( 20/92 ) in the paclitaxel stent group ( P = .001 vs balloon angioplasty ). When compared with balloon angioplasty , receiving a sirolimus stent had a relative risk ( RR ) of angiographic restenosis of 0.32 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.18-0 .56 ) ; a paclitaxel stent had an RR of 0.49 ( 95 % CI , 0.31-0 .76 ). The incidence of target vessel revascularization was 33.0 % ( 33/100 ) in the balloon angioplasty group , 8.0 % ( 8/100 ) in the sirolimus stent group ( P < .001 vs balloon angioplasty ) , and 19.0 % ( 19/100 ) in the paclitaxel stent group ( P = .02 vs balloon angioplasty ). The secondary analysis showed a trend toward a lower rate of angiographic restenosis ( P = .19 ) and a significantly lower rate of target vessel revascularization ( P = .02 ) among sirolimus stent patients compared with paclitaxel stent patients. In patients with in-stent restenosis , a strategy based on sirolimus - or paclitaxel-eluting stents is superior to conventional balloon angioplasty for the prevention of recurrent restenosis. Sirolimus-eluting stents may be superior to paclitaxel-eluting stents for treatment of this disorder. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Studies have demonstrated that high levels of insulin , often seen in sedentary individuals , are associated with increased risk of breast cancer recurrence and death. We sought to analyze whether exercise lowered insulin concentrations in breast cancer survivors. One hundred one sedentary , overweight breast cancer survivors were randomly assigned either to a 16-week cardiovascular and strength training exercise intervention or to a usual care control group. Fasting insulin and glucose levels , weight , body composition , and circumference at the waist and hip were collected at baseline and 16 weeks. Baseline and 16-week measurements were available for 82 patients. Fasting insulin concentrations decreased by an average of 2.86 microU/mL in the exercise group ( P = .03 ) , with no significant change in the control group ( decrease of 0.27 microU/mL , P = .65 ). The change in insulin levels in the exercise group seemed greater than the change in controls , but the comparison did not reach statistical significance ( P = .07 ). There was a trend toward improvement in insulin resistance in the exercise group ( P = .09 ) but no change in fasting glucose levels. The exercise group also experienced a significant decrease in hip measurements , with no change in weight or body composition. Participation in an exercise intervention was associated with a significant decrease in insulin levels and hip circumference in breast cancer survivors. The relationship between physical activity and breast cancer prognosis may be mediated , in part , through changes in insulin levels and/or changes in body fat or fat deposition. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Statin therapy reduces the level of C-reactive protein independently of its effect on lipid levels. We hypothesized that statins might prevent coronary events in persons with elevated C-reactive protein levels who did not have overt hyperlipidemia. The level of C-reactive protein was measured at base line and after one year in 5742 participants in a five-year randomized trial of lovastatin for the primary prevention of acute coronary events. The rates of coronary events increased significantly with increases in the base-line levels of C-reactive protein. Lovastatin therapy reduced the C-reactive protein level by 14.8 percent ( P < 0.001 ) , an effect not explained by lovastatin-induced changes in the lipid profile. As expected , lovastatin was effective in preventing coronary events in participants whose base-line ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol was higher than the median ratio , regardless of the level of C-reactive protein ( number needed to treat for five years to prevent 1 event , 47 ; P = 0.005 ). However , lovastatin was also effective among those with a ratio of total to HDL cholesterol that was lower than the median and a C-reactive protein level higher than the median ( number needed to treat , 43 ; P = 0.02 ). In contrast , lovastatin was ineffective among participants with a ratio of total to HDL cholesterol and a C-reactive protein level that were both lower than the median ( number needed to treat , 983 ; P = 0.80 ). Statin therapy may be effective in the primary prevention of coronary events among subjects with relatively low lipid levels but with elevated levels of C-reactive protein. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Randomized , double-blind , parallel-group comparative study. 186 patients with a big toenail showing onychomycosis symptoms such as opacity. Patients were assigned to Group I ( 200 mg/d , 3 cycles ) , Group II ( 200 mg/d , 6 cycles ) or Group III ( 400 mg/d , 3 cycles ). All received itraconazole orally. Cure or complete response - assessment based on improvement in the opacity ratio and microscopic examination. The clinical response rates ( cure plus complete response ) at week 24 were Group I : 14.9 % ; Group II : 25.5 % ; Group III : 32.7 %. At week 48 , 17 patients were cured in Group III - up from 3 at week 24. At week 48 the area under the nail plate concentration-time curves ( AUC ) was : Group I : 6,084 + / - 3,696 ng h/g ; Group II : 10,448 + / - 6,980 ng h/g ; Group III : 24,189 + / - 15,157 ng h/g. There was no difference among the three groups in the incidence of adverse drug reactions. The clinical response rates demonstrated that the pulse therapy of 400 mg/d itraconazole for 3 cycles was most effective. The significantly higher Group III AUC ( week 48 ) suggests that , when the same total amount of itraconazole is administered , this drug remains in nail plates longer following pulse therapy with a higher daily dose. It was also suggested that clinical efficacy correlated with the duration of the presence of itraconazole. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Psychocorrection including neuroleptic significantly raises the efficacy of SOC treatment and relieves pain , hypochondric fixations and depressive disorders. The reduction of pain syndrome intensity in the course of psychocorrection correlates with attenuation of hypochondric disorders and inclination to fixation. As to predictors of the treatment effect , the strongest relief of pain in psychocorrection was achieved in patients with hypochondric and anxiodepressive disorders. Combined psychocorrection comprising minimal doses of neuroleptic trifluoperasine and psychorelaxation is effective in the treatment of SOC patients with long-term pain syndrome. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Patients with ischemic stroke enrolled in the Management of Atherothrombosis with Clopidogrel in High Risk Patients ( MATCH ) Study underwent prospective assessment of their modified Rankin score ( mRS ) at 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , and 18 months after enrollment and after recurrent stroke. Patients disabled ( defined as mRS > or = 3 ) after recurrence were analyzed for recovery ( defined as mRS < 3 ) during the 18 months , and predictors of recovery were sought using a Cox proportional-hazard multiple regression analysis. Three hundred forty-five ( 54 % ) of 637 patients were disabled after recurrent ischemic stroke ; 115 ( 33 % ) patients had been disabled and 230 ( 66 % ) nondisabled before stroke recurrence. At recurrence , the degree of disability was moderate ( mRS 3 ) in 135 ( 39 % ) patients , severe ( mRS 4 ) in 139 ( 40 % ) , and very severe ( mRS 5 ) in 71 ( 21 % ). After 12 months ' median follow-up , 117 ( 34 % , 95 % CI : 29 to 39 % ) had recovered : 68 ( 50 % , 42 to 59 % ) of 135 moderately disabled , 45 ( 32 % , 25 to 41 % ) of 139 severely disabled , and 4 ( 6 % , 2 to 14 % ) of 71 very severely disabled ; 70 ( 20.3 % ) patients died. From recurrence , median time to recovery was 6 months ( mRS 3 ) and 18 months ( mRS 4 ) ; 94 % with very severe disability had not recovered at 18 months. Independent predictors of recovery were moderate disability at recurrence ( mRS 3 ) compared with severe ( mRS 4 : hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.5 ; 95 % CI 1.04 to 2.3 ) or very severe disability ( mRS 5 : HR 7.6 ; 2.7 to 20 ) and a nondisabled vs disabled state before recurrence ( HR 4.0 ; 2.3 to 6.8 ).

To test , in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial , the hypothesis that a small short-term increase in the dose of prednisolone will reduce the release of cytokines and thereby reduce the risk of relapse. Sequential patients receiving low-dose ( < 0.6 mg/kg ) prednisolone on alternate days as maintenance therapy were recruited. At the first sign of a presumed viral URTI , all children were examined and randomly allocated to take medicine A or B ( containing either prednisolone ( 5 mg ) or placebo ) in the first viral URTI , and vice versa in the second. If the criteria for diagnosis of a viral URTI were met , the new medicine was prescribed on alternate days for 1 week at the same dose as that of the prednisolone being taken by the patient on an alternate-day basis. A freshly voided urine sample was tested each morning. The presence of 3 + proteinuria for 3 consecutive days was diagnostic of relapse. 48 patients were recruited , and 40 completed the trial ( 29 male ; 11 female ). Age at entry ranged from 1.5 to 13.2 ( median 5.3 ) years. The relapse rate after viral URTI was 19/40 ( 48 % ) in the placebo group and 7/40 ( 18 % ) in the prednisolone group ( p = 0.014 ; two-sided probability using Fisher 's exact test ). Prescribing prednisolone daily for 7 consecutive days at the same dose as that taken by the patient on an alternate-day basis at the onset of a presumed viral URTI significantly reduces the risk of relapse in children with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Postmenopausal osteoporotic women ( n = 423 ) were randomized initially into a 2-year , double-blind , multicenter study ; it was extended to a third year of blinded treatment followed by open-label treatment : 357 patients continued treatment in Year 3 ( 305 receiving blinded therapy and 52 receiving calcium supplementation ) and 277 in Year 4. During Years 1 through 3 , patients received double-blind treatment with phosphate ( 1.0 g ) or placebo twice daily for 3 days , etidronate ( 400 mg ) or placebo daily for 14 days , and calcium ( 500 mg ) daily for the remainder of each 91-day treatment cycle. During Year 4 , open-label intermittent cyclic etidronate therapy ( without preceding phosphate ) was administered to all patients. Spinal bone density and vertebral fracture rates were the main outcome measures. During Year 3 , etidronate therapy maintained the significant increases in spinal bone mineral density of the first 2 years. Over the 3-year period , proximal femur bone density increased in etidronate-treated patients. Etidronate therapy for 3 years significantly decreased the vertebral fracture rate in patients at higher risk for fracture ( low spinal bone density and three or more vertebral fractures at study entry ) , as compared with nonetidronate treatment ( 228 versus 412 fractures per 1,000 patient-years , respectively ; p < 0.05 ). After 1 year of open-label treatment , patients previously treated with etidronate maintained bone mass , and vertebral fracture rates in all groups were lower than in any other study period. There were no apparent serious adverse effects. Three years of intermittent cyclic etidronate therapy produced significant increases in spinal and hip bone density , with a significant reduction in vertebral fracture rates in patients at higher fracture risk.

Human molars were ground flat to expose enamel ( n = 80 ) or dentin ( n = 80 ). Specimens in each substrate group were randomly assigned to eight treatment sub-groups , according to four adhesive-luting agent combinations and two test conditions ( with or without thermocycling ). Pre-polymerized composite resin posts ( TPH Spectrum ) were luted to either the enamel or dentin surfaces with one of the following adhesive-luting agent combinations : ( 1 ) Xeno IV Dual Cure ( dual-cure self-etch adhesive ) and Calibra ( dual-cure luting agent ) ; ( 2 ) Prime & Bond NT Dual Cure ( dual-cure total-etch adhesive ) and Calibra ; ( 3 ) OptiBond All-in-One Dual Cure ( dual-cure self-etch adhesive ) and Nexus 2 Dual Syringe ( dual-cure luting agent ) ; ( 4 ) OptiBond Solo Plus Dual Cure ( dual-cure total-etch adhesive ) and Nexus 2 Dual Syringe. For each treatment sub-group , half the specimens ( n = 10 ) were tested after 24h storage in water at 37 degrees C , and the other half ( n = 10 ) were tested after thermocycling for 1800 cycles between water baths held at 5 and 55 degrees C , with a dwell time in each bath of 30s , and a transfer time of 10s. Bond strengths were measured in shear mode , and expressed in MPa. The fracture mode ( adhesive , cohesive , mixed ) was examined. Data were analyzed for statistical significance with a factorial ANOVA and post hoc tests. Mean enamel bond strengths ranged from 8.4 MPa for non-thermocycled OptiBond All-in-One | Nexus 2 to 35.5 MPa for non-thermocycled Prime & Bond NT | Calibra. Mean dentin bond strengths ranged from 14.5 MPa for non-thermocycled OptiBond Solo Plus | Nexus 2 to 30.9 MPa for thermocycled Xeno IV | Calibra. The fracture mode was predominantly adhesive for all groups. On enamel , the total-etch adhesives performed better than their self-etch counterparts , while in dentin , the opposite was found , i.e. , the self-etch adhesives performed better than their total-etch counterparts. Thermocycling for 1800 cycles did not affect the SBS of the materials tested to dentin and enamel. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Recent ESC guidelines suggest that transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) may be considered for assessment of coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) and microvascular disease in patients with stable angina , but its reliability has not been tested in patients with DES. We sought to assess the agreement between TTE ( CFRTTE ) and invasive thermodilution-derived CFR ( CFRThermodilution ) as well as their association with index of microcirculatory resistance ( IMR ) in mid-term follow-up after percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndrome. CFRTTE and CFRThermodilution were assessed 3 months after DES implantation in the left anterior descending artery in 24 patients. Patients with haemodynamically significant epicardial stenosis ( fractional flow reserve < 0.75 ) were excluded. Correlation between the two methods was good ( r = 0.71 , P < 0.001 ) , but CFRThermodilution ( mean SD ) tended to be higher ( 3.17 1.00 vs. 2.87 0.72 ; mean difference 0.29 , 95 % confidence interval -0.06 to 0.59 ). In Bland-Altman analysis , there was a trend towards a greater difference in the range of higher invasive values. Nevertheless , TTE was successful in discriminating moderately impaired CFR ( 2.5 ) ( P = 0.001 ) and severely impaired CFR ( 2.0 ) ( P < 0.001 ) when compared with an invasive method. No association between either CFR measurements vs. IMR measurement was detected , suggesting that in addition to microcirculatory function , CFR also accounts for epicardial vasodilator function in the absence of haemodynamically significant stenosis. TTE is a feasible and reliable method for the assessment of CFR and vasodilator dysfunction after DES implantation. Values obtained with this method successfully find abnormal CFR confirmed with the invasive thermodilution method. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Subcutaneous ( SC ) hydration facilitated by recombinant human hyaluronidase offers an alternative treatment for dehydration. This clinical trial is the first to compare recombinant human hyaluronidase-facilitated SC ( rHFSC ) rehydration with standard IV rehydration for use in dehydrated children. This Phase IV noninferiority trial evaluated whether rHFSC fluid administration can be given safely and effectively , with volumes similar to those delivered intravenously , to children who have mild to moderate dehydration. The study included mild to moderately dehydrated children ( Gorelick dehydration score ) aged 1 month to 10 years. They were randomized to receive 20 mL/kg of isotonic fluids using rHFSC or IV therapy over 1 hour and then as needed until clinically rehydrated. The primary outcome was total volume of fluid administered ( emergency department [ ED ] plus inpatient hospitalization ). Secondary outcomes included mean volume infused in the ED alone , postinfusion dehydration scores and weight changes , line placement success and time , safety , and provider and parent/guardian questionnaire. 148 patients ( mean age , 2.3 [ 1.91 ] years ] ; white , 53.4 % ; black , 31.8 % ) were enrolled in the intention-to-treat population ( 73 rHFSC ; 75 IV ). The primary outcome , mean total volume infused , was 365.0 ( 324.6 ) mL in the rHFSC group over 3.1 hours versus 455.8 ( 597.4 ) mL in the IV group over 6.6 hours ( P = 0.51 ). The secondary outcome of mean volume infused in the ED alone was 334.3 ( 226.40 ) mL in the rHFSC group versus 299.6 ( 252.33 ) mL in the IV group ( P = 0.03 ). Dehydration scores and weight changes postinfusion were similar. Successful line placement occurred in all 73 rHFSC-treated patients and 59 of 75 ( 78.7 % ) IV-treated patients ( P < 0.0001 ). All IV failures occurred in patients aged < 3 years ; rHFSC rescue was successful in all patients in whom it was attempted. Both treatments were well tolerated. Clinicians rated fluid administration as easy to perform in 94.5 % ( 69 of 73 ) of the rHFSC group versus 65.3 % ( 49 of 75 ) of the IV group ( P < 0.001 ). Parents/caregivers were satisfied or very satisfied with fluid administration in 94.5 % ( 69 of 73 ) of rHFSC-treated patients and 73.3 % ( 55 of 75 ) of IV-treated patients. In mild to moderately dehydrated children , rHFSC was inferior to IV hydration for the primary outcome measure. However , rHFSC was noninferior in the ED phase of hydration. Additional benefits of rHFSC included time and success of line placement , ease of use , and satisfaction. SC hydration facilitated with recombinant human hyaluronidase represents a reasonable addition to the treatment options for children who have mild to moderate dehydration , especially those with difficult IV access.

A relevant and potent mechanism of central sensitization is the central integration of nociceptive impulses. Temporal summation in humans and the wind-up process in animals share common features of central integration. This preclinical and clinical translational study investigated the effect of ketamine and pregabalin on temporal summation ( TS ) and wind-up of wide dynamic range ( WDR ) neurons of nociceptive electrical stimuli in healthy volunteers and rats. This 3-way crossover study included healthy male volunteers ( n = 18 ) receiving 3 doses of 300 mg pregabalin ( orally ) over 2 days , ketamine ( intravenous loading dose 0.5 mg/kg followed by 9 g/kg per minute for 20 mins ) on the first day , or placebo. The pain detection thresholds to repetitive electrical cutaneous and suprathreshold responses stimulation were assessed.In male Sprague-Dawley rats ( n = 30 ) , WDR neuron recordings after electrical stimulation were obtained before and after 15 minutes of intravenous infusion pregabalin ( 0.127 , 0.42 , and 1.27 mg/kg per minute ) and ketamine ( 0.006 , 0.02 , 0.06 , and 0.2 mg/kg per minute ). In the human study , ketamine compared with placebo significantly increased the TS pain detection threshold ( P < 0.001 ) and significantly reduced suprathreshold pain responses ( P < 0.001 ). In rats , the highest dose of ketamine significantly inhibited the wind-up response of the WDR neurons ( P = 0.014 ). Pregabalin affected neither of the parameters in TS and WDR responses. It was shown that TS shares common features with wind-up of WDR neurons and that pregabalin does not affect this component of central sensitization. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Nafamostat mesilate may suppress the blood-foreign surface reaction similar to biocompatible materials by blocking factor XIIa. We performed an in vitro study of cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) with fresh human blood among the following three groups : standard CPB sets ( C ) , biocompatible CPB sets ( B ) , and standard CPB sets with FUT-175 ( 10 mg/L ) ( F ). A clinical study using these same CPB groups also was performed in 45 patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass operations ( 15 patients each ). We injected FUT-175 at 40 mg/h during CPB. In the in vitro study , both groups B and F showed significantly lower levels of coagulation factors , thrombin-antithrombin III complex , fibrinopeptide A , beta-thromboglobulin , complement C3a , granulocyte elastase , and free hemoglobin than group C at the conclusion of the study. Thrombin-antithrombin III complex and free hemoglobin in group F also were lower than in group B. The platelet count remained at a higher level in group F than in the other groups. Separation of bradykinin was suppressed most significantly in group F. In the clinical study , group F also showed significantly lower levels of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor plasmin complex and C3a than both groups C and B. There were minimal levels of free hemoglobin in group F.

The clinical sample consisted of 60 patients ( mean age 13.5 years ) with maxillary transverse deficiency requiring expansion. The subjects were randomly divided into three groups on which different expansion protocols were performed. An evaluation of the subjective symptoms was carried out by a Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ). The patients completed questionnaires after the first , fifth , tenth , twentieth and final activations. A Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to evaluate homogenity ; a Kruskall Wallis test was performed for gender-related differences and to compare the different activation schedules. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the activations at the various time intervals. No gender-related differences were found. Ninety-eight percent of the patients reported pain during RME. There were no specific differences between groups except for the pain perceived at the twentieth activation. In all groups , pain , the sensation of pressure and its duration were highest at the fifth activation. Subjective symptoms tended to decrease after the fifth and tenth activations.

A clinically relevant CNS effect was predefined as more than 45 degrees s-1 reduction in saccadic peak velocity ( SPV ) , corresponding to the effects of one night 's sleep deprivation. In a randomized , double-blind fashion , 35 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension received placebo run-in medication for 2 weeks , followed by 4 weeks ' moxonidine sustained release ( 1.5 mg o.d. ) or placebo. On the first day and 1 and 4 weeks following the start of treatment , blood pressure was measured and CNS effects were assessed using SPV , visual analogue scales and EEG. On day 1 there was a significant , but not clinically relevant , reduction in the time-corrected area under the effect curve ( AUEC ) for SPV in the moxonidine group compared with placebo [ difference of 38 degrees s-1 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 23 , 52 ]. This difference was no longer significant after one ( 9 degrees s-1 ; 95 % CI -17 , 35 ) and 4 weeks ( 6.9 degrees s-1 ; 95 % CI -16 , 30 ). Visual analogue scales for alertness showed similar results. A decrease in EEG alpha - and beta-power and an increase in delta-power were only found on day 1 of moxonidine treatment. The AUEC for systolic/diastolic blood pressure relative to placebo was 23 ( 95 % CI 17 , 29 ) / 13 ( 9 , 16 ) mmHg lower on day 1 and remained reduced by 20 ( 11 , 30 ) / 12 ( 6 , 17 ) and 15 ( 6 , 25 ) / 9 ( 3 , 15 ) mmHg after 1 and 4 weeks ' moxonidine treatment.

To examine the frequency , temporal development , and stability of objectively derived motor changes during placebo treatment in PD and to define the clinical domains and demographic groups most affected. The authors examined the placebo-treated group from a randomized , multicenter , placebo-controlled clinical trial of monotherapy ropinerole in PD patients without motor fluctuations. In 105 patients , they evaluated placebo-associated effects on the motor section of the Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , dividing the motor examination into four categories : tremor , bradykinesia , rigidity , and gait/balance/midline functions. The motor UPDRS and its subscales were compared over time ( at baseline and at 4 , 12 , and 24 weeks ) using Wilcoxon 's signed rank test. They applied a rigorous definition of placebo-associated improvement as an improvement over baseline score in motor UPDRS of at least 50 % or a change in at least two motor items at any one visit by > or = 2 points. During the 6-month study , 16 % of subjects improved on placebo treatment. The prevalence of response was steady ( 8 to 9 % ) at any one visit without a predominance of an early effect. No patient showed a placebo-associated improvement on all visits. All domains of parkinsonian disability were subject to placebo-associated improvement , with a trend toward more response in bradykinesia and rigidity than in tremor or gait/balance/midline function. Gender , age , disease duration , and baseline disability score did not influence the likelihood of improvement in association with placebo treatment. Based on a rigorous definition of placebo-associated improvement , prominent improvements in objective measures of PD disability occur during clinical trials. Because placebo-associated improvements occur throughout a 6-month trial , placebo-controlled studies in PD should be at least 6 months to capture early as well as late improvements. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

We investigated the correlation of the viral and host factors , including the degree of sequence complexity of the HCV genome for responses to interferon-alpha in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Ninety-seven patients received a 26-week course of recombinant interferon-alpha 2a therapy. The sequence complexity of the envelope 1-2 region was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated single-strand conformation polymorphism ( PCR-SSCP ) analysis. Of the 85 patients who completed the treatment , 31 ( 36 % ) achieved a sustained response , and 28 ( 33 % ) showed a sustained loss of HCV RNA. A low HCV RNA level , determined by the branched DNA probe assay , and serotype group 2 HCV correlated with a sustained response. In patients with serotype group 1 HCV of more than the threshold of the branched DNA probe assay , a band number on PCR-SSCP analysis of more than 2 could be associated with inefficacy of interferon therapy. Multivariate analysis in the 50 patients whose sera were available for all the virologic tests showed that only the HCV RNA level is independently predictive of a sustained response. Determination of the HCV RNA level is most important for predicting the response before interferon therapy. PCR-SSCP analysis may be useful as an additional test for patients with a high HCV RNA level of serotype group 1 HCV. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Achieving glycemic control safely with insulin therapy can be challenging. A prospective , 16-week , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study conducted at 50 sites in the United States and 1 site in Mexico between August 12 , 2004 , and December 28 , 2005. Subjects had type 2 diabetes mellitus that was not adequately controlled ( glycated hemoglobin level , 7.5 % -9.5 % , inclusive ) receiving insulin therapy alone or in combination with oral antidiabetes agents. In total 287 subjects ( 52 % men ; mean age , 57 years ; with a mean baseline glycated hemoglobin level of 8.3 % ) were randomized : 147 to receive colesevelam hydrochloride , 3.75 g/d , and 140 to receive placebo. Using the least squares method , the mean ( SE ) change in glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to week 16 was -0.41 % ( 0.07 % ) for the colesevelam-treated group and 0.09 % ( 0.07 % ) for the placebo group ( treatment difference , -0.50 % [ 0.09 % ] ; 95 % confidence interval , -0.68 % to -0.32 % ; P < .001 ). Consistent reductions in fasting plasma glucose and fructosamine levels , glycemic-control response rate , and lipid control measures were observed with colesevelam. As expected , the colesevelam-treated group had a 12.8 % reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration relative to placebo ( P < .001 ). Of recipients of colesevelam and placebo , respectively , 30 and 26 discontinued the study prematurely ; 7 and 9 withdrew because of protocol-specified hyperglycemia , and 10 and 4 withdrew because of adverse events. Both treatments were generally well tolerated. Colesevelam treatment seems to be safe and effective for improving glycemic control and lipid management in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving insulin-based therapy , and it may provide a novel treatment for improving dual cardiovascular risk factors. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

A secondary objective was to assess the cardiovascular and respiratory effects of the two opioid drugs. Thirty-seven male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to one of six treatment groups. For all treatment groups anaesthesia was induced with 5 % isoflurane in oxygen using an induction chamber. A 14-gauge catheter was used for endotracheal intubation , and anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane delivered in oxygen via a T-piece breathing system. A baseline determination of the minimum alveolar concentration of isoflurane ( MACISO ) was made for each animal. Fentanyl ( 15 , 30 , 60 micro g kg-1 hour-1 ) or remifentanil ( 60 , 120 , 240 micro g kg-1 hour-1 ) were infused intravenously into a previously cannulated tail vein. Thirty minutes after the infusion started , a second MACISO ( MACISO + drug ) was determined. The carotid artery was cannulated to monitor the arterial pressure and to take samples for arterial gas measurements. Cardiovascular ( heart rate and arterial pressure ) and respiratory ( respiratory rate and presence/absence of apnoea ) effects after opioid infusion were also recorded. Fentanyl ( 15 , 30 , 60 micro g kg-1 hour-1 ) and remifentanil ( 60 , 120 , 240 micro g kg-1 hour-1 ) similarly reduced isoflurane MAC in a dose-dependent fashion : by 10 % at lower doses , 25 % at medium doses and by 60 % at higher doses of both the drugs. Both opioids reduced the respiratory rate in a similar way for all doses tested. No episodes of apnoea were recorded in the remifentanil groups , while administration of fentanyl resulted in apnoea in three animals ( one at each dose level ). The effects on the cardiovascular system were similar with both drugs. We conclude that the intraoperative use of remifentanil in the rat reduces the MAC of isoflurane , and that this anaesthetic sparing effect is dose-dependent and similar to that produced by fentanyl at the doses tested. The use of remifentanil during inhalant anaesthesia in the rat can be considered an intravenous alternative to fentanyl , providing similar reduction in isoflurane requirements. Due to its rapid offset , it is recommended that alternative pain relief be instituted before it is discontinued. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

After down-regulation with the GnRH agonist , buserelin , 114 normo-ovulatory women ( aged 18-37 years ) received r-hFSH alone until the lead follicle reached a diameter of 14 mm. Patients were then randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive r-hFSH in addition to r-hLH , 75 IU s.c. , or placebo daily for a maximum of 10 days prior to oocyte retrieval and IVF. The primary end-point was the number of metaphase II oocytes. There were no significant differences between treatment groups for the primary end-point. Serum estradiol concentrations on the day of HCG administration were significantly higher in the group receiving r-hLH plus r-hFSH than in the group receiving r-hFSH alone ( P = 0.0001 ) , but there were no significant differences between the groups in dose and duration of r-hFSH treatment required , oocyte maturation , fertilization rate , pregnancy rate and live birth rate. In this patient population , the addition of r-hLH during the late follicular phase of a long GnRH agonist and r-hFSH stimulation cycle provides no further benefit in terms of oocyte maturation or other end-points. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

A Cox regression model was used to estimate the effect of fractures ( time-dependent variable ) on survival in patients with stage III multiple myeloma or bone metastases from solid tumors enrolled in 3 large trials. Patients were randomized to receive zoledronic acid , pamidronate , or placebo every 3-4 weeks for up to 24 months ( prostate cancer , breast cancer , and multiple myeloma ) or up to 21 months ( lung and other solid tumors ). A total of 3049 patients with multiple myeloma ( n = 513 ) , breast ( n = 1130 ) , prostate ( n = 640 ) , or lung cancer or other solid tumors ( n = 766 ) were included in this analysis. Patients with multiple myeloma had the highest fracture incidence ( 43 % ) , followed by breast ( 35 % ) , prostate ( 19 % ) , and lung cancer ( 17 % ). In all tumor types except lung , pathologic fracture was associated with a significant increase in risk of death , and breast cancer patients had the greatest increased risk. After adjustment for baseline characteristics , including performance status and prior skeletal complications , breast cancer patients who developed a pathologic fracture on study had a significant 32 % increased risk of death relative to patients without a fracture ( hazard ratio = 1.32 ; P < .01 ) ; patients with multiple myeloma or prostate cancer had a > 20 % increased risk of death.

We sought to understand the types of information that are and should be provided to these donors. Two companion studies were performed. The first investigated blood center practices for care of donors with low Hct including deferral length , information provided , and cutoff values used when referring donors for medical attention. The second was a randomized prospective pilot study comparing behavior of deferred donors receiving an `` older '' pamphlet providing a list of iron-rich foods or a `` newer '' pamphlet providing descriptions of common causes of anemia and advice for seeking medical attention. More than 70 % of centers defer donors for 1 day. Only 6 % defer donors for more than 2 weeks. Most centers provide written and/or verbal information about low Hct. Only 35 % have a cutoff value defining significant anemia that requires additional medical attention. In the study of donors with low Hct , significant disease was identified within 3 months after deferral in 2 of 104 subjects : metastatic lung cancer and acute lymphocytic leukemia. Only donors receiving the newer pamphlet reported that it `` definitely improved '' their ability to speak with their doctor about anemia. The diagnosis of anemia in blood donors may be an indicator of significant undiagnosed disease. There are wide variations in how centers care for and educate donors with anemia.

In this prospective , randomized , double-blind study , 0.9 mL EPI100 and EPI200 solutions were administered for endodontic treatment of mandibular molars with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis in 60 patients. The anesthetic success and pain during anesthesia were evaluated by visual analog scale. The cardiovascular parameters evaluated were heart rate , diastolic/systolic blood pressure , pulse oximetry , and electrocardiogram changes. Both solutions provided high anesthetic efficacy ( 96.8 % and 93.1 % for EPI100 and EPI200 , respectively ; P > .05 ) , and the cardiovascular parameters showed minimal incidences of significant differences throughout the clinical procedure. The epinephrine concentration did not affect the efficacy of 4 % articaine , and both solutions produced a high success level of pulpal anesthesia.

It was predicted that the exposure condition would increase liking for , and consumption of , the vegetable relative to either the reward or control group. Using a randomized controlled design , participants were assigned to one of two intervention groups ( exposure or reward ) or to a no-treatment control condition , for a 2 week period. Liking for , and consumption of , red pepper was assessed before and after the treatment period. The study was conducted in three primary schools in London. Parental consent was obtained for 49 out of a possible 72 children. Interventions comprised eight daily sessions during which participants in the exposure group were offered a taste of sweet red pepper and told that they could eat as much as they liked. Participants in the reward group were shown a sheet of cartoon stickers and told that they could choose one of them on condition that they ate at least one piece of the pepper. The exposure-based intervention significantly increased both liking ( P = 0.006 ) and consumption ( P = 0.03 ) compared with the control group. The outcome of the reward intervention was intermediate and did not differ significantly from the exposure or control conditions.

We hypothesized that transfusion of fresh autologous whole blood obtained prior to heparinization for CPB and infused following CPB would be associated with improved coagulation function when compared with standard therapy. A total of 32 infants 5-12 kg undergoing noncomplex open cardiac surgery were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. In the treatment group , 15 ml x kg ( -1 ) of autologous whole blood was collected into a CPDA bag prior to heparinization while 15 ml x kg ( -1 ) of 5 % albumin was infused intravenously. After reversal of heparin , coagulation tests were drawn in both groups , and the autologous whole blood was infused over 20 min in the treatment group. The treatment group had greater ( P < 0.05 ) improvement in platelet count , prothrombin time , and fibrinogen than the control group. We conclude that collection of fresh autologous whole blood prior to heparinization and reinfusion following CPB is associated with greater improvement of coagulation status after CPB in infants. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

To evaluate this hypothesis the effect of frusemide on PGE2 production from nasal mucosa was studied. Two main arachidonic acid metabolites produced by epithelial cells , PGE2 and 15-hydroxy 5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid ( 15-HETE ) , were measured by radioimmunoassay in nasal secretions obtained by nasal lavages with saline. Eleven healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to two study days , one week apart , in a double blind crossover study. Nasal instillation with three increasing doses of frusemide ( 5 , 10 , and 20 mg ) or placebo was carried out at intervals of 15 minutes. Nasal lavages were performed immediately before nasal instillations and 15 , 30 , and 60 minutes after the last instillation. Baseline concentrations of 15-HETE were at least six times higher than PGE2. No differences between frusemide and placebo were detected either on PGE2 or 15-HETE release. The findings do not support the hypothesis that the antiasthmatic effect of frusemide may be due to increased synthesis of PGE2 or release in the respiratory mucosa. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

The introduction of erythropoietin treatment has changed anemia management , but the therapeutic hemoglobin ( Hb ) target is still under debate , and clinical evidence for its effect on cardiac functions and QOL is sparse. A 16-week dose-response study and a 32-week follow-Up study were combined. After correcting anemia of less than 10 g/dl in pre-dialysis Japanese CKD patients , a higher Hb target ( 12-13 g/dl ) by darbepoetin alfa ( DPO ) was compared with the conventional Hb target by epoetin alfa ( EPO ). Outcomes were anemia correction , management of the left ventricular mass index ( LVMI ) and QOL scores. No significant difference was seen in Hb at baseline and week 16 , but a significant difference was recorded at week 34 ( 12.34 + / - 0.93 g/dl for DPO and 10.43 + / - 0.90 g/dl for EPO ). In both groups , LVMI decreased similarly until week 16 , but the decrease of EPO was retarded , and a significant difference between LVMI was seen only in DPO at week 34 ( 100.7 + / - 16.6 g/m ( 2 ) for DPO and 110.9 + / - 25.2 g/m ( 2 ) for EPO ). Relationships between Hb and LVMI change at week 34 were examined by stratifying Hb into four groups ( Hb < 10 g/dl , 10 g/dl < or = Hb < 11 g/dl , 11 g/dl < or = Hb < 12 g/dl and 12 g/dl < or = Hb ) , and a decrease of LVMI was prominent in the 12 g/dl < or = Hb group. Correction of anemia to 11 g/dl or more led to improved QOL scores. No safety difference was observed among the treatments. Targeting a higher Hb around 12 g/dl was more beneficial than targeting conventional Hb in terms of reduction of LVMI and QOL. Further studies to determine the appropriate Hb target are necessary. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Cefozopran ( CZOP ) is a potential candidate for empirical monotherapy in FN. However , studies on the use of CZOP as empirical treatment for pediatric patients with FN are quite limited. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of CZOP with cefepime ( CFPM ) empirical monotherapy in pediatric cancer patients with FN. A total of 64 patients with 224 episodes of FN were randomly assigned to receive antibiotic therapy with either CZOP ( 100 mg/kg/day ) or CFPM ( 100 mg/kg/day ). Of these episodes , 223 were considered eligible for the study. Success was defined as resolution of febrile episodes and clinical signs of infection within 120 hr following the start of antibiotic therapy. The success rate was not significantly different between the CZOP ( 64.0 % ) and CFPM ( 56.3 % ) groups ( P = 0.275 ). Duration of fever , duration of antibiotic therapy , and the success rate in patients with blood stream infection did not differ between the two groups. There was no infection-related mortality in the study period. Both CZOP and CFPM as monotherapy appear to be effective and safe in pediatric patients.

The null hypothesis was there is no difference with respect to pain scores between ketorolac and iliac crest bupivacaine infusion as analgesic adjuncts to intravenous opioids. A total of 54 children and adolescents ( 27 boys , 27 girls ) undergoing alveolar cleft repair or Le Fort I osteotomy were assigned randomly in a prospective , single-blinded fashion to one of three groups : intravenous ketorolac plus iliac crest normal saline infusion , intravenous ketorolac plus iliac crest bupivacaine infusion , or iliac crest bupivacaine infusion alone. Iliac crest infusions and ketorolac were administered for 48 hours or until discharge , whichever occurred first. All patients received morphine via a patient-controlled analgesia device. Primary outcome was pain score , and secondary outcomes were morphine consumption and satisfaction scores. Pain scores , morphine consumption , and satisfaction scores were not significantly different among groups. Estimated costs were significantly higher for bupivacaine infusion than intravenous ketorolac. Iliac crest donor-site pain is well managed in this patient population.

The pilot study was designed to provide data to inform the design of the definitive study to evaluate the impact of controlled heat on the efficacy of the lidocaine/tetracaine patch ( patch ) when applied before IV cannulation. Subjects in the pilot study were randomized to eight groups that varied by heated vs. unheated patch , 20 vs. 30 minute application , and 16 vs. 18 G catheter. Subjects in the definitive study were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive either the heated or unheated patch , 20 minutes before vascular access , using a 16 G catheter in the antecubital space of the arm. In both studies , the primary efficacy measure was subject-reported pain intensity using a visual analog scale. Pilot study : Subjects who received the heated patch ( n = 43 ) vs. the unheated patch ( n = 37 ) had lower mean pain intensity scores ( 14.7 vs. 23.5 mm , P = 0.04 ). Pain intensity scores did not differ significantly by application time , but the difference between the 16 and 18 G catheter groups approached statistical significance ( 22.8 vs. 14.9 mm , P = 0.05 ). Definitive study : Mean pain intensity scores for the heated patch group ( n = 124 ) vs. the unheated patch group ( n = 126 ) were 14.2 and 20.5 mm , respectively ( P = 0.006 ). Heated patches provided significantly better pain relief compared with unheated patches.

Few data are available about the effects of inulin on Lipoprotein ( a ) , a low-density lipoprotein-like particle considered as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. Adding inulin to pasta could be a preventive strategy for delaying the onset of atherosclerosis. was to evaluate the effects of inulin-enriched pasta on lipid profile and on Lipoprotein ( a ) in young healthy subjects. Twenty-two young healthy male volunteers entered a randomized double blind cross-over study consisting of a 2-weeks run-in period , a baseline assessment , two 5-weeks study periods ( 11 % inulin-enriched or control pasta ) , and an 8-weeks wash-out period in between. Serum lipid concentrations were evaluated by routine biochemical analyses and plasma Lipoprotein ( a ) concentrations by ELISA. The size of apolipoprotein ( a ) isoforms was determined by Western blot and immunodetection. Significant differences at baseline and in the treatment groups were found for HDL-cholesterol ( P = 0.004 ) , total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio ( P = 0.006 ) , triglycerides ( P = 0.04 ) , and Lipoprotein ( a ) ( P = 0.02 ) concentrations ( data analyzed by Friedman test ). Dunn 's multiple comparison test was used to assess the significance of differences between inulin-enriched pasta diet vs. baseline. HDL-cholesterol concentrations increased by 35.9 % ; total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio , triglycerides , and Lipoprotein ( a ) concentrations decreased by 22.2 , 23.4 , and 16.5 % respectively.

To assess the relationship between baseline or change in NTx ( predictive variable ) , and change in lumbar and hip bone mineral density ( BMD ; outcome variable ) , we conducted a 2-year randomized controlled study at academic university and private practice medical centers in 236 healthy women 1 to 3 years postmenopausal ; 227 women completed the study. Women received estrogen plus progesterone plus calcium ( treated group ) or calcium alone ( control group ). In the treated group NTx significantly ( P < 0.0001 ) decreased , and spine and hip BMD significantly ( P < 0.00001 and P < 0.005 , respectively ) increased ; in the control group NTx did not change but BMD decreased significantly ( P < 0.01 ). Subjects in the highest quartiles for baseline NTx ( 67 to 188 units ) or decreasing NTx ( -66 % to -87 % ) through 6 months demonstrated the greatest gain in BMD in response to HRT ( P < 0.05 and P < 0.005 ). For every increase of 30 units in baseline NTx the odds of gain in BMD in response to HRT increased by a factor of 5.0 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.9 to 13.3 ) ; for every 30 % decrease in NTx through 6 months , the odds of gaining BMD in response to HRT increased by a factor of 2.6 ( 95 % CI 1.6 to 4.4 ). In the control group an increase of 30 units in mean NTx across the study indicated a higher odds of losing BMD by a factor of 3.2 ( 95 % CI 1.6 to 6.5 ). A high baseline NTx ( > 67 units ) indicated a 17.3 times higher risk of BMD loss if not treated with HRT. These data support the clinical utility of NTx to monitor the antiresorptive effect of HRT in recently postmenopausal women , and to predict changes in BMD in response to HRT. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

We sought to identify the predictors of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy , death , and response to inhaled nitric oxide. Among 85 neonates studied , an extrapulmonary right-to-left shunt through either an oval foramen and/or an arterial duct was present in 80 ( 94 % ) cases. In the 64 patients ( 75 % ) with adequate images for measurements , left ventricular ejection fraction was normal or mildly depressed in 87 % , but there was a decreased index of left ventricular output , inferior to 2 l/min/m2 , in 61 % of the cases. Using multivariate analysis , an exclusive right-to-left ductal shunt was found to be an independent predictor of death , with odds ratio of 7.8 , and 95 % confidence intervals from 1.2 to 52.8 , with a p value of 0.04. There was also a non-significant trend toward greater use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with a predominant left-to-right ductal shunt , the odds ratio being 0.13 , with 95 % confidence intervals from 0.01 to 1.22 , and a p value of 0.07. In the 40 patients randomised to receive inhaled nitric oxide , 28 had a positive response as defined by a 20 % reduction in the index of oxygenation as measured from the post-ductal arterial blood gas sample. A left-to-right atrial shunt increased the risk of failing to respond to inhaled nitric oxide , with an odds ratio of 7.46 , 95 % confidence intervals from 1.23 to 45.1 , and a p value of 0.028.

The Antiphospholipid Antibody Acetylsalicylic Acid ( APLASA ) study was a multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial in which asymptomatic , persistently aPL-positive individuals were randomized to receive a daily dose of 81 mg of aspirin or placebo. In a separate observational and parallel study , asymptomatic , persistently aPL-positive individuals who were taking aspirin or declined randomization were followed up prospectively. In the APLASA study , 98 individuals were randomized to receive aspirin or placebo ( mean + / - SD followup period 2.30 + / - 0.95 years ) , of whom 48 received aspirin and 50 received placebo. In the observational study , 74 nonrandomized individuals were followed up prospectively ( mean + / - SD followup period 2.46 + / - 0.76 years ) ; 61 received aspirin and 13 did not. In the APLASA study , the acute thrombosis incidence rates were 2.75 per 100 patient-years for aspirin-treated subjects and 0 per 100 patient-years for the placebo-treated subjects ( hazard ratio 1.04 , 95 % confidence interval 0.69-1 .56 ) ( P = 0.83 ). Similarly , in the observational study , the acute thrombosis incidence rates were 2.70 per 100 patient-years for aspirin-treated subjects and 0 per 100 patient-years for those not treated with aspirin. All but 1 patient with thrombosis in either study had concomitant thrombosis risk factors and/or systemic autoimmune disease at the time of thrombosis. Our results suggest that asymptomatic , persistently aPL-positive individuals do not benefit from low-dose aspirin for primary thrombosis prophylaxis , have a low overall annual incidence rate of acute thrombosis , and develop vascular events when additional thrombosis risk factors are present. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

These complications are more common in children. This study was designed to determine if humidification of isoflurane in oxygen/nitrous oxide would reduce respiratory complications and hypoxic episodes at induction. Fifty-nine unpremedicated children , aged three months to 12 yr , were enrolled in the study and randomised to receive either humidified isoflurane ( n = 27 , Group A ) , or non-humidified isoflurane ( n = 32 , Group B ). All inductions of anaesthesia were with isoflurane 4 % in 50 % oxygen/nitrous oxide. Subjects were observed for the occurrence of breath-holding , coughing , laryngospasm , bronchospasm , secretions , and hiccoughs. The severity of each complication was graded on a scale of 0-3. The need to administer 100 % oxygen and/or succinylcholine was also identified. Coughing ( 33 % vs 53 % ) was more frequent in Group B ( P < 0.05 ). Coughing severity scores ( 13 vs 36 ) and breath-holding severity scores ( 8 vs 19 ) were also greater in Group B ( P < 0.05 ). A change in FIO2 was required more frequently in Group B ( 4 % vs 16 % ). Although there was a high incidence of laryngospasm in both groups ( 52 % vs 59 % ) , no other differences were identified , breath-holding ( 26 % vs 31 % ) , secretions ( 30 % vs 31 % ) , hiccough ( 11 % vs 12.5 % ) ( P > 0.05 ).

The CHARM-Added trial describes the largest experience of using multiple inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) together. 2548 HF patients , taking an ACE-I ( 936 no spironolactone/no beta blocker ; 1175 no spironolactone/beta blocker ; 199 spironolactone/no beta blocker ; 238 sprionolactone/beta blocker ) , were randomized to placebo or candesartan and followed for 41 months ( median ). The primary outcome was cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization. In patients taking both a beta blocker and spironolactone ( in addition to an ACE-I ) at baseline , the candesartan : placebo hazard ratio was 0.85 ( 95 % CI 0.56 , 1.29 ) , compared to 0.85 ( 95 % CI 0.75 , 0.96 ) in all randomized patients ( interaction p value 0.49 ). The relative risk of discontinuation of candesartan ( compared to placebo ) because of hypotension , increased serum creatinine or hyperkalemia was not increased in patients taking spironolactone at baseline. An ARB may provide added benefit , at acceptable risk , in HF patients already taking spironolactone as well as an ACE-I and beta blocker.

A parenteral lipid emulsion with a multicomponent composition may improve growth and neurodevelopment and may prevent liver injury , which is often observed in association with long-term parenteral nutrition with pure soybean oil. Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a multicomponent lipid emulsion containing 30 % soybean oil , 30 % medium-chain triacylglycerol , 25 % olive oil , and 15 % fish oil compared with a conventional pure soybean oil emulsion in VLBW infants. We conducted a double-blind randomized controlled trial in VLBW infants randomized to parenteral nutrition with the multicomponent ( study group ) or pure soybean oil emulsion ( control group ) from birth at a dose of 2 to 3 g kg ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) until the infants were receiving full enteral nutrition. We assessed efficacy by growth rates and measuring plasma fatty acid profiles ( representative subset ). Safety was evaluated by assessing hematologic and biochemical parameters , potentially harmful phytosterol concentrations ( same subset ) , and clinical neonatal outcome parameters. Ninety-six infants were included ( subsets n = 21 ). The multicomponent emulsion was associated with higher weight and head circumference z scores during admission. Plasma eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid concentrations were higher in the study group. The hematological , biochemical , and neonatal outcomes were not different between groups , whereas the plasma concentrations of phytosterols were higher in the control group. The multicomponent lipid emulsion was well tolerated and associated with improved growth and higher plasma fatty acid profiles in VLBW infants in comparison with the pure soybean oil emulsion. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Hypothetically , these data would assist the radiotherapist to determine the appropriate duration of pre-radiotherapy downsizing neoadjuvant luteinizing hormone releasing hormone ( LHRH ) treatment. A second aim was to assess any increase of the prostatic volume during the 1st year of diagnosis in patients who were allocated to a deferred treatment policy ( DAD ). METHODS AND MATERIALS Thirteen patients in the IAD cohort and 13 patients in the DAD group , all with T1-3pN1-2M0 prostate cancer , had regular computed tomography/magnetic resonance ( CT/MR ) examinations during the 1st year after randomization within the EORTC-GU trial 30846. Pre-treatment prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) values were available in only 12 patients. In the IAD group the prostate gland decreased with significant difference as compared with the DAD patients ( P = 0.033 ). As compared with the pre-treatment situation the prostate gland in the IAD group was reduced in size by 18 , 35 , and 46 % at 1 , 6 , and 12 months , respectively. In four of six evaluable IAD patients the prostatic volume continued to shrink after achievement of the nadir PSA level ( at 3 months ). In three of the 13 DAD patients the prostate volume increased by > 25 % during the 1st 3 months after randomization. If neoadjuvant androgen deprivation is applied before local treatment to downsize the volume of the cancerous prostate gland , our limited data suggest that such treatment should last at least 6 months in order to achieve a maximal effect in the majority of patients. In about 1/4 of untreated patients an increase in the prostate volume by > 25 % may occur within 3 months of diagnosis. If no AD is given , radiotherapy should start within this period. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

The use of prokinetics to improve VCE completion rates to the cecum remains unclear. The objective of this study was to determine whether erythromycin increases the completion rate of VCE to the cecum without adversely affecting image quality. This was a prospective , randomized , single-blinded control trial at St. Vincent 's Hospital , Melbourne , Australia. A total of 86 consecutive patients referred for VCE were considered for entry ; 45 patients met the entry criteria. These 45 patients were prospectively randomized to no erythromycin ( controls , n = 23 ) or 250 mg erythromycin ( n = 22 ). Two gastroenterologists , who were unaware of which group the patients were randomized into , reported all VCEs. The number of VCEs that reached the cecum within the 8-hour study period , gastric emptying time ( GET ) , and small-bowel transit time ( SBTT ) were calculated for each group. There was no significant difference in the number of VCEs that reached the cecum ( 32 % failed to reach the cecum in the erythromycin group compared with 22 % in the control group ) , GET , or SBTT between the two groups. Image quality was not adversely affected by the use of erythromycin. The dose and the preparation of erythromycin used in this study may have possibly had an effect on GET and SBTT. The use of erythromycin did not significantly increase the likelihood of the capsule reaching the cecum or affect the degree of visible peristalsis or the interpretation of capsule findings. \nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

Fifty-six consecutive patients were stratified into two groups : cytomegalovirus-positive recipients ( n = 40 ) and cytomegalovirus-negative recipients of organs from cytomegalovirus-positive donors ( n = 16 ). All patients received equine antithymocyte globulin induction for 7 days and maintenance doses of cyclosporine , azathioprine , and prednisolone. Ganciclovir ( 5 mg/kg intravenously ) or matching placebo was given with the premedication , three times weekly for the first 6 weeks after transplantation and for another 2 weeks for each treated rejection episode between 6 and 12 weeks. Ganciclovir prophylaxis reduced the actuarial incidence of cytomegalovirus disease from 71 % to 11 % in cytomegalovirus-mismatched patients ( p < 0.01 ). Ganciclovir prophylaxis did not reduce the incidence of cytomegalovirus disease in cytomegalovirus-positive recipients ( 25 % in both placebo and ganciclovir groups ) but did delay its onset and reduce its morbidity. There were no adverse reactions during ganciclovir administration. Gastritis was the most common clinical manifestation of cytomegalovirus disease. Pneumonitis and myocarditis were seen only in placebo-treated cytomegalovirus-mismatched patients. All patients with clinical cytomegalovirus disease responded to ganciclovir , 10 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks.

A second aim of the study was to examine the effects of a cycle training , with and without parental involvement , on levels of cycling to school and on parental attitudes towards cycling. Three participating schools were randomly assigned to the `` intervention '' ( 25 children ) , the `` intervention plus parent '' ( 34 children ) or `` control '' condition ( 35 children ). A cycle training ( four sessions of 45 min ) took place only in the intervention schools. Parents in the `` intervention plus parent '' condition were asked to assist their child in completing weekly homework tasks. Children 's cycling skills were assessed , using a practical cycling test. All participating children also received a short parental questionnaire on cycling behavior and parental attitudes towards cycling. Assessments took place at baseline , within 1 week after the last session and at 5-months follow-up. Repeated measure analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of the cycle training. Children 's total cycling skill score increased significantly more from pre to post and from pre to 5-months follow-up in the intervention group than in the control group. On walking with the bicycle ( F = 1.6 ) , cycling in a straight line ( F = 2.6 ) , cycling a slalom ( F = 1.9 ) , cycling over obstacles ( F = 2.1 ) , cycling on a sloping surface ( F = 1.7 ) and dismounting the bicycle ( F = 2.0 ) , the cycle training had no effect. For all other cycling skills , significant improvements were observed on short - and longer-term. No significant intervention effects were found on children 's cycling to school levels ( F = 1.9 ) and parental attitudes towards cycling. The cycle training course was effective in improving children 's cycling skills and the improvements were maintained 5 months later.

Patients who completed the 3-week acute phase and entered into the 44-week maintenance phase ( n = 147 ) of the trial were included. Service use data were collected at weeks 3 , 7 , 15 , 23 , 31 , 39 and 47 of the maintenance phase. Analyses were conducted to address potential biases from discontinuation patterns and use of this patient sub-sample. Overall , per patient yearly costs were similar for olanzapine - and divalproex-treated patients ( $ 14 967 vs. $ 15 801 ). Psychiatric-related costs accounted for 95.4 % and 93.6 % of the total costs for olanzapine - and divalproextreated patients , respectively. Study medication costs were significantly higher for olanzapine than for divalproex ( $ 4662 vs. $ 1755 , p < 0.01 ). However , this was offset by the combined effects of numerically lower costs for several other services with olanzapine treatment. Some of the savings associated with olanzapine treatment compared with divalproex treatment resulted from differences in costs associated with emergency room services ( $ 432 vs. $ 1346 , p < 0.05 ). Overall per-patient treatment costs were similar for olanzapine and divalproex.

Current guidelines for bronchoprovocation testing recommend exclusion of caffeine the day of testing. The effects of caffeine on methacholine challenge testing ( MCT ) , now more commonly performed than histamine challenge , are unknown. Sixteen well-controlled asthmatics with a forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV ( 1 ) ) > 65 % predicted and methacholine provocation concentration causing a 20 % fall in FEV ( 1 ) ( PC ( 20 ) ) 16 mg/ml participated in a randomized single-blind crossover study. The two treatments included 16 ounces of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee given on two separate days. The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide ( eNO ) and FEV ( 1 ) were measured before and 1 h after each treatment. One hour post treatment blood was drawn for serum caffeine level and the MCT was done. Fourteen subjects completed the study ; there were no adverse events. No significant bronchodilation was seen between the mean FEV ( 1 ) values before and after the caffeinated treatment ( 3.31 0.75 L and 3.36 0.74 L , respectively ). No significant bronchoprotection was seen between the caffeinated and decaffeinated treatment 's geometric mean PC ( 20 ) values ( 1.35 mg/ml and 1.36 mg/ml , respectively ). Mean eNO values before and after caffeinated treatment were not significantly different ( 31.2 19.6 ppb and 31.5 20.4 ppb ). The amount of caffeine in a normal dietary serving of a 16 oz cup of coffee is not enough to cause significant bronchoprotection , bronchodilation , or decrease eNO values.
