Blood was drawn repeatedly up to 36 h after the bolus , and tested for the activated clotting time ( ACT ) and activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) .\nMETHODS\tThe APTT reagent was chosen among five commercial reagents to yield a linear increase in the clotting time among possible therapeutic S 18326 concentrations in vitro .\nMETHODS\tTo accurately measure the thrombin-inhibiting effects of low doses of S 18326 ( < 0.5 microm ) , we developed a specific chromogenic assay .\nMETHODS\tWe also measured F1 + 2 prothrombin fragment levels to assess the effect of S 18326 on thrombin generation in vivo .\nRESULTS\tA two-compartment pharmacokinetic model was fitted to the S 18326 plasma concentration vs time data by using population pharmacokinetic methods .\nRESULTS\tResults of the pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic relationships showed that both the ACT and APTT methods yielded a linear increase according to the S 18326 concentration measured using a highly sensitive analytical method .\nRESULTS\tAt the end of infusion , ACT was prolonged 1.20 and 1.95-fold in the 0.5 mg h-1 and the 3 mg h-1 groups , respectively , and APTT was prolonged 1.27 and 2.75-fold .\nRESULTS\tThrombin inhibition plateaued above 0.5 microm of S 18326 according to an Emax model , confirming that the test was highly sensitive .\nRESULTS\tF1 + 2 levels fell significantly after the 24 h S 18326 infusion ( 0.83 nm to 0.6 nm and 0.80 nm to 0.44 nm in the 0.5 mg h-1 and the 3 mg h-1 groups , respectively ) , but remained stable after the placebo infusion .\nCONCLUSIONS\tOur results support specific monitoring of the thrombin inhibitor S 18326 with ACT and APTT to establish the safety range of the drug in further studies .\nCONCLUSIONS\tMoreover , the fall in F1 + 2 prothrombin fragments suggests that S 18326 effectively reduces the retroactivation of factors V and VIII by thrombin .\n\nYou start all of your responses with <ANSWER> and end them with </ANSWER>, as shown in the following example: \n<QUESTION>Orteronel was developed for treatment of which cancer?</QUESTION>\n<ANSWER> castration-resistant prostate cancer</ANSWER>\nYou must now answer the following biomedical question AS SUCCINCTLY AS YOU CAN.
