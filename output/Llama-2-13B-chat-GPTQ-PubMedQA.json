Snippets:There has never been a nationally representative survey of medical students' personal health-related practices, although they are inherently of interest and may affect patient-counseling practices. This study evaluated the health practices and the vaccination status of first year residents working at the academic hospital H\u00f4tel-Dieu de France.The medical files of all medicine and surgery residents in their first year of specialization between the years 2005 and 2008 were reviewed. These residents were required to go through a preventive medical visit at the University Center of Family and Community Health.One hundred and nine residents (109) were included in the study; 68 (6239%) were male and 41 (37.61%) were female with a mean age of 26 years. Only 6 residents (5.50%) practiced physical activity according to international guidelines (more than three times a week for more than 30 minutes each time). Most residents (n = 76 ; 69.73%) used to skip one or two meals especially breakfast and as a consequence 30 male (44.11%) and 4 female (9.75%) students were overweight, with a statistical difference between the two sexes (Fisher test, p-value = 0.001). Twenty-eight residents (25.69%) were smokers with a male predominance. Fourteen residents of both genders (12.84%) drank alcohol regularly (>3 times a week) and 71 (65.14%) had a drink occasionally (once a month or less). Only 25 residents (23%) of the cohort had a complete and up-to-date immunization status. The immunization gap was basically against measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis (dT Polio). Ninety-nine residents (90.83%) had full immunization against hepatitis B with an adequate response in 78 residents (71.56%).

Snippets:To assess the feasibility and safety of diagnostic or therapeutic semirigid ureteroscopy without ureteral meatus dilatation.A comparative, retrospective study was conducted of patients undergoing ureteroscopy from January 2000 to May 2008. For data analysis purposes, the population was divided into two groups based on whether ureteroscopy had been performed with (Group 1) or without (Group 2) ureteral meatus dilatation. Variables recorded included age, sex, type of procedure, surgical diagnosis, passive or active dilatation, number of stones, stone location, stone diameter, peroperative and postoperative complications, internal urinary diversion after the procedure, therapeutic success rate, operating time, and hospital stay duration. A 8-9.8 Fr Wolf semirigid ureteroscope was used. Descriptive statistics of the population and cohorts were performed, providing medians, quartiles, and limit values for non-normally distributed interval variables, and absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables. Shapiro-Wilk's, Mann-Whitney's U, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests were used for statistical analysis. A value of p 2 alpha<or = 0.005 was considered statistically significant. Arcus Quickstat Biomedical 1.0 software was used.Among the 306 ureteroscopies studied, 286 performed in 256 patients were analyzed. Median age was 50 years (16-83), 59% of patients were male, and elective ureteroscopy was performed in 183 patients (64%). Group 1: 191 ureteroscopies, Group 2: 95 ureteroscopies. Stone location: 149 in distal ureter, 60 in middle ureter, and 35 in proximal ureter. Sixty-nine percent of stones had sizes ranging from 5 and 10 mm. The overall success rate was 86.5%. There were 5 peroperative and 22 postoperative complications, with no statistically significant differences between the groups.

Snippets:The seafaring industry remains a hazardous occupation that requires sophisticated systems of risk and fitness assessment. This study aims to investigate the extent of agreement between Approved Doctors (ADs) and Medical Referees (MRs) when they assess a seafarer's fitness.Between 2003 and 2009 a total of 232,878 seafarer medical examinations were carried out by ADs, of which 465 were considered by the MRs because the seafarer appealed against the AD's decision. The extent of agreement between ADs and MRs was studied.Two hundred and sixty-eight (58%) cases seen by the ADs were classed as category 4 \"permanently unfit\"; the referees only placed 85 (18%) of them in this category. On the other hand, 252 (54%) cases seen by the MRs were classed as category 2 \"fit with restrictions\", while the ADs had only placed 111 (24%) in this category. The overall agreement between the assessors (AD vs. MR) was poor (Kappa K = 0.18).For cardiovascular diseases and for mental ill-health, access to additional information by the MR was the commonest reason for changing the fitness category, but for all other conditions factors such as the experience and knowledge of the MRs or their different interpretation of the standards were the most frequent reasons for a change to fitness category or to restrictions.

We did not detect any improvement in either England or Scotland, or any differences between England and Scotland in the understanding of the lack of benefit of antibiotics for coughs and colds, and we found no improvement in antibiotic use. We detected a significant increase in respondents retaining leftover antibiotics. Over 20% reported discussing antibiotics with their general practitioner (GP) or nurse in the year to January 2009. The offer of a delayed antibiotic prescription was reported significantly more often by English respondents (19% versus 8% Scottish in 2009; P = 0.01), and English respondents were advised to use other remedies for coughs and colds significantly more often in the year to January 2009 (12.7% in 2009 versus 7.4% in 2008; P<0.001).

Snippets:To determine whether decreasing lengths of stay over time for selected diagnostic categories were associated with increased hospital readmission rates and mean number of physician visits after discharge.Retrospective descriptive study.The seven large (125 beds or more) acute care hospitals in Winnipeg.Manitoba residents admitted to any one of the seven hospitals because acute myocardial infarction (AMI), bronchitis or asthma, transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) and uterine or adnexal procedures for nonmalignant disease during the fiscal years 1989-90 to 1992-93. Patients from out of province, those who died in hospital, those with excessively long stays (more than 60 days) and those who were transferred to or from another institution were excluded.Length of hospital stay, and rate of readmission within 30 days after discharge for all four categories and mean number of physician visits within 30 days after discharge for two categories (AMI and bronchitis or asthma.The length of stay decreased significantly over the 4 years for all of the four categories, the smallest change being observed for patients with AMI (11.1%) and the largest for those with bronchitis or asthma (22.0%). The readmission rates for AMI, bronchitis or asthma, and TURP showed no consistent change over the 4 years. The readmission rate for uterine or adnexal procedures increased significantly between the first and second year (chi 2 = 4.28, p = 0.04) but then remained constant over the next 3 years. The mean number of physician visits increased slightly for AMI in the first year (1.92 to 2.01) and then remained virtually the same. It decreased slightly for bronchitis or asthma over the 4 years. There was no significant correlation between length of stay and readmission rates for individual hospitals in 1992-93 in any of the four categories. Also, no correlation was observed between length of stay and mean number of physician visits for individual hospitals in 1992-93 in the categories AMI and bronchitis or asthma.

Snippets:To assess pain intensity with and without subcutaneous local anesthesia prior to intraarticular administration of contrast medium for magnetic resonance arthrography (MRa) of the shoulder.This single-center study was conducted after an IRB waiver of authorization, between January 2010 and December 2012. All patients provided written, informed consent for the procedure. Our prospectively populated institutional database was searched, based on our inclusion criteria. There were 249 outpatients (178 men and 71 women; mean age, 44.4 years \u00b1 14.6; range, 15-79) who underwent MRa and were enrolled in this study. Patients were excluded if they had received surgery of the shoulder before MRa, had undergone repeated MRa of the same shoulder, and/or had undergone MRa of both shoulders on the same day. Patients were randomly assigned into one of three groups. Patients in group A (n=61) received skin infiltration with local anesthesia. Patients in control group B (n=92) and group C (n=96) did not receive local anesthesia. Pain levels were immediately assessed after the injection for MRa using a horizontal visual analog scale (VAS) that ranged from 0 to 10. To compare the pain scores of the three groups for male and female patients, a two-way analysis of variance was used. A p-value equal to or less than 0.05 was considered to indicate a significant result.Patients who received local anesthesia (group A) showed a mean pain level on the VAS of 2.6 \u00b1 2.3. In patients who did not receive local anesthetics (groups B and C), a mean pain level on the VAS of 2.6 \u00b1 2.2 and 2.7 \u00b1 2.4 were detected, respectively. Between the three groups, no statistically significant difference in pain intensity was detected (p=.960).

The aim of this study was to determine if patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) would be physically able to participate.A consecutive cohort of RA patients undergoing podiatry care underwent tests for sight, reach and grip strength to determine their physical ability to undertake self-managed foot care.Thirty RA patients (10 male, 20 female), with a median age of 61 years (range 42 to 84) and disease duration of 10 years (range one to 40), were recruited. All patients passed the sight test, whereas the reach and grip tests were passed by 77% and 67% of patients, respectively. Only 57% of patients passed all the physical tests. Patients who failed the physical tests were older, and had longer disease duration and higher physical disability, pain and general health scores but these were not statistically different.

Given your training on biomedical data, you are an expert on questions related to biology and medicine. You are given the following snippets, from which you must extract the answer to a question. Snippets:The differential diagnosis between essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) may be, in some cases, very difficult on clinical grounds alone. In addition, it is accepted that a small percentage of ET patients presenting symptoms and signs of possible PD may progress finally to a typical pattern of parkinsonism. Ioflupane, N-u-fluoropropyl-2a-carbomethoxy-3a-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane, also called FP-CIT, labelled with (123)I (commercially known as DaTSCAN) has been proven to be useful in the differential diagnosis between PD and ET and to confirm dopaminergic degeneration in patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this study is to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT (123)I-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs.Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals.Qualitative (Visual) interpretation of the SPECT data did not find any difference in the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at the level of the S, CN and P between NV and ET patients. Reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the P of all PD patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV. Patients with left hemi-parkinsonism, demonstrated reduced radioligand uptake in the right putamen in comparison with ET and NV. Clinical follow-up of 20 patients with ET at (so many months afterwards) revealed no significant change in clinical presentation, particularly no signs of PD. Follow-up DaTSCAN performed in 10 of them (so many months afterwards) was negative in all but one. This one had an equivocal baseline study which deteriorated 12\u00a0months later.

Snippets:Occlusion of the atherosclerotic ascending aorta by an endoaortic inflatable balloon has been proposed as an alternative to conventional cross-clamping to prevent injury to the vessel and distal embolization of debris. The safety and the effectiveness of endoaortic occlusion have not been documented in this setting.Endoaortic occlusion was employed in 52 of 2,172 consecutive patients. Surgeon's choice was based on preoperative identification of aortic calcifications or intraoperative epiaortic ultrasonographic scanning. Deaths and strokes were analyzed casewise and in aggregate.In 10 patients (19.2%), the endoaortic balloon had to be replaced by the ordinary cross-clamp because of incomplete occlusion (n = 5), hindered exposure (n = 2), or balloon rupture (n = 3). In-hospital death occurred in 13 patients (25%), and stroke on awakening from anesthesia in 2 (3.8%). The death rate of patients treated by endoaortic occlusion was significantly higher compared with all other patients (4.2%, p<0.0001) and with the expected estimate by European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (10.5%, p = 0.05). By multivariable analysis, use of endoaortic occlusion was independently associated with in-hospital death (odds ratio = 5.609, 95% confidence interval: 2.684 to 11.719). Although the stroke rate was higher in the endoaortic occlusion group compared with all other patients, the difference was only possibly significant (3.8% versus 0.8%, p = 0.067).

For the following, your response MUST start with <ANSWER> and end with </ANSWER>. You must answer with NOTHING OTHER THAN Yes, No or Maybe. Given your training on biomedical data, you are an expert on questions related to biology and medicine. You are given the following snippets, from which you must extract the answer to a question. Snippets:Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique lumbar spine radiographs are often a standard part of the evaluation of children who are clinically suspected of having spondylolysis. Recent concerns regarding radiation exposure and costs have brought the value of oblique radiographs into question. The purpose of the present study was to determine the diagnostic value of oblique views in the diagnosis of spondylolysis.Radiographs of fifty adolescents with L5 spondylolysis without spondylolisthesis and fifty controls were retrospectively reviewed. All controls were confirmed not to have spondylolysis on the basis of computed tomographic scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, or bone scanning. Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique radiographs of the lumbar spine were arranged into two sets of slides: one showing four views (anteroposterior, lateral, right oblique, and left oblique) and one showing two views (anteroposterior and lateral only). The slides were randomly presented to four pediatric spine surgeons for diagnosis, with four-view slides being presented first, followed by two-view slides. The slides for twenty random patients were later reanalyzed in order to calculate of intra-rater agreement. A power analysis demonstrated that this study was adequately powered. Inter-rater and intra-rater agreement were assessed on the basis of the percentage of overall agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). PCXMC software was used to generate effective radiation doses. Study charges were determined from radiology billing data.There was no significant difference in sensitivity and specificity between four-view and two-view radiographs in the diagnosis of spondylolysis. The sensitivity was 0.59 for two-view studies and 0.53 for four-view studies (p = 0.33). The specificity was 0.96 for two-view studies and 0.94 for four-view studies (p = 0.60). Inter-rater agreement, intra-rater agreement, and agreement with gold-standard ICC values were in the moderate range and also demonstrated no significant differences. Percent overall agreement was 78% for four-view studies and 82% for two-view studies. The radiation effective dose was 1.26 mSv for four-view studies and 0.72 mSv for two-view studies (difference, 0.54 mSv). The charge for four-view studies was $145 more than that for two-view studies. You must now respond to the following question with NOTHING OTHER THAN Yes, No or Maybe given the context above.
