For the following, your response MUST start with <ANSWER> and end with </ANSWER>. You must answer with NOTHING OTHER THAN Yes, No or Maybe. Given your training on biomedical data, you are an expert on questions related to biology and medicine. You are given the following snippets, from which you must extract the answer to a question. Snippets:To assess the feasibility and safety of diagnostic or therapeutic semirigid ureteroscopy without ureteral meatus dilatation.A comparative, retrospective study was conducted of patients undergoing ureteroscopy from January 2000 to May 2008. For data analysis purposes, the population was divided into two groups based on whether ureteroscopy had been performed with (Group 1) or without (Group 2) ureteral meatus dilatation. Variables recorded included age, sex, type of procedure, surgical diagnosis, passive or active dilatation, number of stones, stone location, stone diameter, peroperative and postoperative complications, internal urinary diversion after the procedure, therapeutic success rate, operating time, and hospital stay duration. A 8-9.8 Fr Wolf semirigid ureteroscope was used. Descriptive statistics of the population and cohorts were performed, providing medians, quartiles, and limit values for non-normally distributed interval variables, and absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables. Shapiro-Wilk's, Mann-Whitney's U, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests were used for statistical analysis. A value of p 2 alpha<or = 0.005 was considered statistically significant. Arcus Quickstat Biomedical 1.0 software was used.Among the 306 ureteroscopies studied, 286 performed in 256 patients were analyzed. Median age was 50 years (16-83), 59% of patients were male, and elective ureteroscopy was performed in 183 patients (64%). Group 1: 191 ureteroscopies, Group 2: 95 ureteroscopies. Stone location: 149 in distal ureter, 60 in middle ureter, and 35 in proximal ureter. Sixty-nine percent of stones had sizes ranging from 5 and 10 mm. The overall success rate was 86.5%. There were 5 peroperative and 22 postoperative complications, with no statistically significant differences between the groups. You must now respond to the following question with NOTHING OTHER THAN Yes, No or Maybe given the context above. Do not justify your response, respond with only Yes, No or Maybe. <QUESTION>Diagnostic and therapeutic ureteroscopy: is dilatation of ureteral meatus always necessary?</QUESTION><ANSWER>  Based on this study, it appears that dilatation of the ureteral meatus may not be necessary for diagnostic and therapeutic ureteroscopy.</ANSW"], ["Does managed care enable more low income persons to identify a usual source of care?", "maybe", "MAYBE."], ["Knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and functional ambulation: are they related in Parkinson's disease?", "yes", "Yes."], ["Is distance to provider a barrier to care for medicaid patients with breast, colorectal, or lung cancer?", "no", "Yes."], ["Can folic acid protect against congenital heart defects in Down syndrome?", "no", "Maybe."], ["Are there mental health differences between francophone and non-francophone populations in manitoba?", "maybe", "Yes."], ["Does type 1 diabetes mellitus affect Achilles tendon response to a 10\u00a0km run?", "no", "MAYBE."], ["Fragility of the esophageal mucosa: a pathognomonic endoscopic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis?", "yes", "Yes."], ["Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?", "yes", "MAYBE."], ["Pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of fallot: are we operating too late?", "yes", "MAYBE."], ["Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis: a premalignant condition?", "no", "MAYBE."], ["Does TDP-43 type confer a distinct pattern of atrophy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration?", "yes", "Yes."], ["Is oncoplastic surgery a contraindication for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method?", "maybe", "MAYBE."], ["Diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder: does the \"Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)\" sample generalize?", "yes", "MAYBE."], ["Estimation of basal metabolic rate in Chinese: are the current prediction equations applicable?", "yes", "MAYBE."], ["Does rugby headgear prevent concussion?", "maybe", "Maybe."], ["Spinal subdural hematoma: a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm?", "yes", "Yes."], ["Can shape analysis differentiate free-floating internal carotid artery thrombus from atherosclerotic plaque in patients evaluated with CTA for stroke or transient ischemic attack?", "yes", "Yes."], ["Dementia and aphasia in motor neuron disease: an underrecognised association?", "yes", "Yes."], ["Does solid culture for tuberculosis influence clinical decision making in India?", "maybe", "Yes."], ["Diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging of primary parotid gland tumors: is a prediction of different histologic subtypes possible?", "yes", "Yes."], ["Is there a role for endothelin-1 in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis?", "maybe", "Yes."], ["Do risk factors for suicidal behavior differ by affective disorder polarity?", "no", ""], ["Multidisciplinary breast cancer clinics.
