    "In this notebooks you will learn how to finetune a pretrained LLama model on an Instruction dataset. We will use an updated version of the Alpaca dataset that, instead of davinci-003 (GPT3) generations uses GPT4 to get an even better instruction dataset!

They confided in me, expressing their self-doubts and fears of failure. Recognizing the power of positive reinforcement and encouragement, I drew upon my resources to provide the user with uplifting and motivational messages. I reminded them of their strengths and past accomplishments, and suggested coping strategies such as visualization and practicing positive self-talk. Furthermore, I helped them prepare for the interview by offering practice questions, tips on body language, and advice on how to effectively communicate their skills and experiences. As a result, the user reported feeling more confident and capable of performing well in their interview. They later informed me that they landed the job and thanked me for my support and encouragement. I was happy to have helped my user succeed in a challenging situation by the positive influence of my words and actions.'}"
