# BioLlama
(Temporarily) private repository to accompany the Level 4 Research Project "Retrieval enhancement of biomodels in a compute-scarce environment".

The aim of this project is to enhance models of varying sizes from the Llama2 family with retrieval methods, potentially through RAG, RETRO, FID and other methods. Temporary focus lies on the downstream task of biomedical question answering, but may be extended to include any or all of Named entity recognition (NER), Relation extraction (RE), Natural language inference (NLI), Document classification (DC), Question answering (QA) and Open-domain QA (OpenQA).
